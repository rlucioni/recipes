# Burgers

Yields 4 burgers

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds beef chuck (fatty, flavorful, tough cut), trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- 4 buns (potato works well), toasted
- toppings (cheese, caramelized onions, tomato, carmelized pineapple, etc.)

## Instructions

1. Freeze meat and butter in a single layer until meat is firm, about 35 minutes.
2. Grind in food processor until finely ground into pieces about the size of rice grains.
3. Gently pack into 4 patties about 3/4 inch thick. Make a depression in the center of each patty to keep them flat when they cook. Season exterior with salt and pepper.
4. Sear in a hot cast iron pan, 4-7 minutes per side without moving, until 125Â°F in the center for medium-rare.
5. Let patties rest on buns for 5 minutes with some cheese on top, so it melts.

Serve with fries or potato chips and a pickle.
