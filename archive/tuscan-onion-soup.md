## Ingredients

- 4 pounds red onions, sliced with the grain
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 3 sage leaves, plus more, thinly sliced, for toast
- black pepper
- tiny pinch of cinnamon
- 1/4 cup almonds, finely ground
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 5-6 cups chicken or beef broth

## Instructions

1. Saute onions with olive oil and kosher salt in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once the heat through and slump down in the pan, reduce heat to medium and cook until very soft and sweet, about 1 hour. Don't brown them!
2. Add sage, pepper, cinnamon, and ground almond. Stir and cook 2-3 minutes.
3. Transfer onions to a pot. Add vinegar and broth. Bring to a simmer on high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste for seasoning.
4. Apply olive oil, sliced sage, and cheese to bread slices. Toast in a 400Â°F oven until browned, about 15 minutes.

To serve, put toast in the bottom of bowls and top with soup. Top with olive oil and cheese.
