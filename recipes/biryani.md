# Biryani

Serves 8.

## Ingredients

### Biryani masala

Makes a lot, keep extra in the freezer.

- 3 bay leaves
- 2 star anise
- 10 green cardamom pods
- 3 black cardamom pods
- 1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces
- 1 teaspoon cloves
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 3 tablespoons coriander seeds
- 2 tablespoons caraway seeds
- 1 mace (enough to cover the surface of a whole nutmeg)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg

### Marinated chicken

- 2 2/3 cup whole milk yogurt (a runnier yogurt works well)
- 2 tablespoons biryani masala
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 2 teaspoons Kashmiri chili powder
- 12 cloves garlic, grated
- 8-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 6 green chilies, split in half
- juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 16 chicken thighs and/or drumsticks

### Parboiled rice

- 4 1/2 cups aged basmati rice (use Daawat Ultima brand)
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 1/2 cinnamon stick
- 18 cloves
- 12 green cardamom pods
- 3 star anise
- 3 black cardamom pods
- 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds

### Other ingredients

- 1 large pinch of saffron
- 1/2 cup milk, warmed in the microwave
- 2 large red onions, finely sliced with the grain and separated
- 1/2 cup finely-chopped cilantro
- 1/2 cup finely-chopped mint

## Instructions

1. Toast all the spices for the biryani masala except the ground nutmeg in a dry pan until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
2. Grind toasted spices in a spice grinder until finely ground. Sift through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the chaff. Re-grind and re-sift any large pieces.
3. Mix with ground nutmeg and reserve. Store extra in the freezer!
4. Mix marinade and massage into chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours up to overnight.
5. Add saffron to warm milk and reserve.
6. Wash rice gently until water runs clear. Soak in water for 30 minutes and drain.
7. Boil well-salted water in a large pot and add spices. Boil for 5 minutes. Add soaked rice and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the rice is about 80% cooked. Rice should be al dente at this point. Drain and reserve.
8. Fry the onions until uniformly golden brown, reserving on a paper-towel lined plate. You can do this in a pot with a few tablespoons of ghee, working in 2 batches. You can also use the microwave, again in 2 batches: microwave for 5 minutes at first, stir, then continue until they're uniformly brown, decreasing the time gradually as you get closer (1 minute at a time near the end).
9. Add chicken and all the marinade to a pressure cooker (or large pot) and cook until very fragrant and chicken is about half cooked. Mix in 2/3 of the fried onions. Taste and adjust the seasoning and reserve half of the chicken and sauce.
10. Layer in 1/3 of the cilantro and mint, followed by half of the rice. Sprinkle over several pinches of biryani masala.
11. Layer in the rest of the chicken and sauce, another 1/3 of the cilantro and mint, and the rest of the rice. Top with the rest of the fried onions, the rest of the cilantro and mint, and another few pinches of biryani masala. Drizzle over the saffron-infused milk.
12. Seal the pressure cooker, but don't worry about pressurizing. Cook on medium for 10 minutes. Lower to low and cook an additional 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Don't remove the lid during the cooking and resting process.

Serve with yogurt or [raita](raita.md).
