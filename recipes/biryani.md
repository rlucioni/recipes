### Other ingredients

- 1 large pinch of saffron
- 6 tablespoons milk, warmed in the microwave
- 2 large red onions, finely sliced with the grain on a mandolin and separated
- 1/2 cup ghee
- 1/2 cup finely-chopped cilantro
- 1/2 cup finely-chopped mint

## Instructions

1. Toast all the spices except the ground nutmeg in a dry pan until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
2. Grind toasted spices in a spice grinder until finely ground. Sift through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the chaff.
3. Mix with ground nutmeg and reserve in a glass jar. Store extra in the freezer!
4. Mix marinade and massage into chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours up to overnight.
5. Add saffron to warm milk and reserve.
6. Wash rice gently until water runs clear. Soak in water for 30 minutes and drain.
7. Boil well-salted water in a large pot and add spices. Boil for 5 minutes. Add soaked rice and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the rice is about 80% cooked. Rice should be al dente at this point. Drain and reserve.
8. Heat ghee in a large dutch oven. Fry onions in batches until golden brown and crispy and reserve on a paper towel-lined plate.
9. Add chicken and all the marinade to the dutch oven and cook until very fragrant and chicken is about half cooked. Mix in 2/3 of the fried onions. Taste and adjust the seasoning and reserve half of the chicken and sauce.
10. Layer in 1/3 of the cilantro and mint, followed by half of the rice. Sprinkle over a couple pinches of biryani masala.
11. Layer in the rest of the chicken and sauce, another 1/3 of the cilantro and mint, and the rest of the rice. Top with the rest of the fried onions, the rest of the cilantro and mint, and another couple pinches of biryani masala. Drizzle over the saffron-infused milk.
12. Cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil and a tight-fitting lid. Cook on high for 10 minutes. Lower to low and cook an additional 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid any time during the cooking and resting process.
