## Instructions

2. In the meantime, saute shrimp in olive oil and a pinch of salt in a large pan until just barely cooked. Reserve.
3. Saute zucchini in olive oil until mostly softened. Add cherry tomatoes and cook 2-3 minutes until softened.
4. Add drained pasta, pesto, reserved shrimp, and about 1/4 cup of pasta cooking water.
