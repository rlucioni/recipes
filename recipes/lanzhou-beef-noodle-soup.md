# Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup

## Ingredients

### Soup

- 6-7 pounds meat + bone material (e.g., 4 pounds bone-in beef short rib, 1/2 chicken, 2 pounds soup bones)
- 1 quart nice stock/broth if you can find it, otherwise just water
- 7 star anise
- 12 cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 5 bay leaves
- 6 slices of sand ginger (or equivalent dried galangal)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
- 1 1/2 teaspoons white peppercorns
- 5 licorice root slices (optional, but recommended)
- 3 pieces dried orange peel
- 1 black cardamom
- 1 daikon radish, thinly sliced and quartered

### Everything else

- [noodles](alkaline-noodles.md)
- baby bok choy, blanched
- chopped scallions and cilantro
- [chili oil](chili-oil.md)

## Instructions

1. Boil meat and bone material vigorously for a few minutes before draining and rinsing. Clean and dry pot.
2. Add all the spices to the dry pot and toast until fragrant. Return meat and bone material to the pot. Add stock if using, then enough water to barely cover.
3. Cover and cook at high pressure for 30 minutes. Natural release.
4. Remove meat. Strain broth. Return to pot. Add daikon and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Skim fat while the daikon is simmering.
5. Prepare noodles and toppings. Serve!

When reheating, it works well to bring the soup and meat back to a boil in a pot.
