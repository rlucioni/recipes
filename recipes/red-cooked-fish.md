# Red Cooked Fish

## Ingredients

- 2 (totaling 2 1/2 pounds) flaky, white fish (e.g., tilapia, sea breem), cleaned and descaled
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 nub ginger, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 Thai bird chilies, optional, halved
- 8 scallions, cut into large pieces
- 1 cup Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 3 1/2 tablespoons Chinkiang black vinegar
- 1 1/2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Rinse fish and pat dry. Score both sides three times.
2. Heat oil, ginger, garlic, white parts of scallions, and chilies over medium heat. Just before they start to brown, add wine, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce.
3. Add both fish and bring the liquid to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes on each side, basting constantly, until fish reaches an internal temperature of 130-135Â°F.
4. Use two spatulas to remove each fish to its own serving plate. Mix cornstarch with a bit of water and add to the sauce, along with reserved scallion greens. Cook until scallions are wilted. Pour sauce over both fish.
