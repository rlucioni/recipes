# Red Cooked Fish

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dry sherry (or Shaoxing wine)
- 3 1/2 tablespoons Chinkiang black vinegar
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 1/2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 2 (totaling ~2 1/2 pounds) flaky, white fish (e.g., orata, branzino), cleaned, fins and scales removed
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 nub ginger, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 Thai bird chilies, optional, halved
- 8 scallions, cut into large pieces, whites and greens separated
- 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Mix sherry, black vinegar, soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. Reserve.
2. Rinse fish and pat dry. Score both sides three times.
3. Heat oil, ginger, garlic, white parts of scallions, and chilies over medium heat. Just before they start to brown, add both fish.
4. Pour over the reserved braising liquid. Add sugar.
5. Bring the liquid to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes on each side, basting constantly, until fish reaches an internal temperature of 130-135Â°F.
6. Use two spatulas to remove each fish to its own serving plate. Mix cornstarch with a bit of water and add to the sauce, along with reserved scallion greens. Cook until scallions are wilted. Pour sauce over both fish.

Serve with rice.
