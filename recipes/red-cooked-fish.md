# Red Cooked Fish

## Ingredients

- 2 (totaling 2 1/2 pounds) flaky, white fish (e.g., tilapia, sea breem), cleaned and descaled
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 nub ginger, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 Thai bird chilies, optional, halved
- 3 scallions, cut into large pieces
- 3/4 cup Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 1/2 tablespoons Chinkiang black vinegar
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Rinse fish and pat dry. Score both sides three times and dust with a thin layer of cornstarch.
2. Heat oil, ginger, garlic, and chilies over medium heat. Just before they start to brown, remove and reserve.
3. Brown both sides of the fish, moving it as little as possible, about 5 minutes per side.
4. Add back reserved ginger and garlic, plus scallions, wine, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce. Cook over medium-low heat, basting constantly until fish is done and sauce is syrupy, about 5 minutes per side.

Serve with rice.
