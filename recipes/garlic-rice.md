# Garlic Rice

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3-5 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 cup rice (ideally long grain)
- 2 cups water
- 3/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a medium-size pot. Add garlic. Sizzle briefly without browning, then stir in rice. Be patient and toast the rice. You want it to dry out and turn an opaque white.
2. Mix in water and cover. Cook on medium heat until water simmers down to level of rice, then lower heat and cook until you don't see water in the holes that form in the rice, about 10 minutes. Bottom should be dry if you check around the outside. Kill heat and leave covered for at least 5 minutes.

When serving, separate and fluff rice with a fork.
