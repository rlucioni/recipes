# Rice Pudding

Adapted from [Chef John's rice pudding](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/03/coconut-milk-rice-pudding-with-fresh.html).

## Ingredients

### Pudding

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2/3 cup arborio rice
- 2 cups coconut milk (Aroy-D is best)
- 6 cups milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 egg yolks, optional

### Garnishes

- grated nutmeg
- 1/4 cup mango, finely diced, with pinch of Chinese five-spice
- 1/4 cup pineapple, finely diced

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a saucepan. Add rice and sizzle for a couple minutes or until fragrant.
2. Add coconut milk, milk, sugar, and salt. Bring to a simmer.
3. Simmer, stirring constantly, until the rice is cooked to the desired texture. Remember it thickens when cooled; if it looks perfect in the pot, it'll be too thick.
4. Kill heat and stir in vanilla and egg yolks, if using.

Portion into dessert cups and cover with plastic. Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator or serve at room temperature.
