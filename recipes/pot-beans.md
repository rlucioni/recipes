# Pot Beans

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dry beans, checked for debris and soaked about 6 hours
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4-5 carrots, chopped
- 4-5 celery stalks, chopped
- 2-3 garlic cloves, crushed
- bay leaf
- kombu (optional)
- salt

## Instructions

1. Saute aromatics with olive oil and salt. Add garlic, bay leaf, and kombu, if using.
2. Add beans and enough liquid to cover by about 2 inches.
3. Bring to a rapid boil for 15 minutes.
4. Lower heat to a gentle simmer. Partially cover and cook until beans are done, 1-3 hours. If the cooking water starts to get low, add hot water (from a kettle).
5. If necessary, salt as beans are just starting to soften. Careful not to oversalt, especially if you used chicken stock that has now reduced.
