# Pot Beans

Adapted from [Rancho Gordo bean cooking tips](https://www.ranchogordo.com/blogs/recipes/cooking-basic-beans-in-the-rancho-gordo-manner)

## Ingredients

### Basics

- 1 pound dry beans, checked for debris and soaked 4-6 hours
- salt
- bay leaf

### Optional additions

- 1 onion, chopped
- 4-5 carrots, chopped
- 4-5 celery stalks, chopped
- 2-3 garlic cloves, crushed
- kombu

## Instructions

1. If adding any optional aromatics, saute with olive oil and salt.
2. Add beans and enough water to cover by about 2 inches. Salting now seems to help the beans hold their shape better, but careful not to add too much, especially if you're planning to use the reduced cooking water later.
3. Add any of bay leaf, garlic, and/or kombu.
4. Bring to a rapid boil for 15 minutes.
5. Lower heat to a gentle simmer. Partially cover and cook until beans are done, 1-3 hours. If the cooking water starts to get low, add hot water (from a kettle).
