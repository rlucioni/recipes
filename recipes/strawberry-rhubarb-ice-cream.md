# Strawberry Rhubarb Ice Cream

Yields 1 1/2 quarts.

## Ingredients

### Strawberry ice cream

- 1 batch [strawberry ice cream](strawberry-ice-cream.md)

### Rhubarb swirl

- 200 grams rhubarb, chopped
- 100 grams sugar
- 1 tablespoon corn syrup
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. Make strawberry ice cream base.
2. While the ice cream base chills, make the rhubarb swirl. In a saucepan, combine rhubarb, sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook over medium to low heat, stirring frequently, until the rhubarb has broken down and the mixture has thickened, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to swirl it into the ice cream.
3. In a long, wide container or loaf pan, layer spoonfuls of the strawberry ice cream, followed by dollops of the chilled rhubarb swirl. Repeat this layering process until all of the ice cream and rhubarb swirl have been used. The top layer should be swirl; give it a few flourishes with a spoon to make it look nice.
4. Cover container with a lid or plastic wrap, then freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.
