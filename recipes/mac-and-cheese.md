# Mac and Cheese

## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- 2 cups water
- 8 ounces elbow macaroni (known to work with De Cecco)
- 4 ounces American cheese (from deli counter), shredded
- 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- pinch cayenne pepper
- 4 ounces sharp cheddar, shredded

## Instructions

1. Boil milk and water in a saucepan. Add macaroni and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly past al dente, about 7 minutes. Add American cheese, mustard, and cayenne. Stir until cheese is totally melted.
2. Kill heat and stir in cheddar until evenly distributed but not melted. Cover saucepan and let stand 5 minutes.
3. Uncover and stir until smooth. It might look a little loose, but it'll thicken as it cools. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
