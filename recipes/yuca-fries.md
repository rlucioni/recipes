# Yuca Fries

## Ingredients

### Fries

- yuca root, peeled and cut into sticks, cores removed
- salt
- vegetable oil

### Sauce

- aji amarillo paste
- mayonnaise
- sour cream
- salt

## Instructions

1. Bring lightly salted water to a boil. Add yuca and simmer vigorously until tender and mostly translucent, about 20-25 minutes. Transfer yuca to wire rack to dry and cool.
2. Mix aji amarillo paste, mayonnaise, sour cream, and salt to taste to make dipping sauce. Reserve.
3. Heat oil to 350Â°F. Transfer yuca to a plate so you can reuse the rack to drain and cool fried pieces. Fry yuca, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, 6-8 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
