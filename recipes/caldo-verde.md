# Caldo Verde

## Ingredients

- 12 ounces Lingui√ßa or Andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 8 cups chicken broth and/or water
- 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and sliced or 30 ounces canned white beans
- 2 pounds Lacinato kale, washed, de-ribbed, and chopped

## Instructions

1. Brown sausage in pot and reserve.
2. Saute onion in sausage fat with some salt. When softened, add garlic, then liquid.
3. Add potatoes and bring to a simmer.
4. Add kale a little at a time, letting it wilt down as you go. Simmer until potatoes break down and kale is soft, about 30 minutes. If using beans, only simmer 20 minutes.
5. Mash potatoes with back of a spoon until soup reaches desired consistency. Add reserved sausage. Season to taste.

Serve with a drizzle of olive oil on top and bread on the side.
