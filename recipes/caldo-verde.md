# Caldo Verde

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried beans or 30 ounces canned beans
- 1 bay leaf and 1 strip kombu (only if using dried beans)
- 12 ounces Lingui√ßa or Andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- parmesan rind (optional)
- 8 cups chicken broth and/or water
- 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
- 2 pounds Lacinato kale, washed, de-ribbed, and chopped
- 3-4 green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. If using dried beans, [cook beans first](beans.md). Don't forget to soak ahead of time!
2. Brown sausage in pot and reserve.
3. Saute onion in sausage fat with some salt. When softened, add garlic, then liquid. If using, add parmesan rind.
4. Add potatoes and bring to a simmer.
5. Add kale a little at a time, letting it wilt down as you go. Simmer until potatoes break down and kale is soft, about 20 minutes.
6. Mash potatoes a little with back of a spoon until soup reaches desired consistency. Add beans, reserved sausage, and green onions. Season to taste.

Serve with a drizzle of olive oil on top and bread on the side.
