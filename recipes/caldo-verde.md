# Caldo Verde

## Ingredients

- 12 ounces Lingui√ßa or Andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 8 cups chicken broth and/or water
- 3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced, or 60 ounces cannellini beans (including canning liquid), or half of each
- 2 pounds Lacinato kale, washed, de-ribbed, and chopped
- 3-4 green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Brown sausage in pot and reserve.
2. Saute onion in sausage fat with some salt. When softened, add garlic, then liquid.
3. Add potatoes and/or beans and bring to a simmer.
4. Add kale a little at a time, letting it wilt down as you go. Simmer until potatoes break down and kale is soft, about 30 minutes. If using beans, only simmer 20 minutes.
5. Mash potatoes a little with back of a spoon until soup reaches desired consistency. Add reserved sausage and green onions. Season to taste.

Serve with a drizzle of olive oil on top and bread on the side.
