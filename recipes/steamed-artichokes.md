# Steamed Artichokes

## Ingredients

- 2 artichokes
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- apple cider vinegar
- dijon mustard
- salt and pepper
- olive oil

## Instructions

1. If the stems are too long, cut them to about a centimeter long. Make sure the cuts are flat so that the artichokes can stand upright on them.
2. Add about an inch of water to the bottom of a pressure cooker. Add in the steamer rack.
3. Add artichokes facing up. Pour a tablespoon of red wine vinegar over each one.
4. Bring the water to a simmer. Put on the lid and bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes.
5. Take off the heat and allow to depressurize naturally.
6. Make a dipping sauce by whisking dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper together. Drizzle in olive oil while whisking.

Serve with dipping sauce on the side.
