# Lemon Bars

For an 8x8 pan

## Ingredients

### Crust

- 142 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup butter, melted

### Filling

- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar, optional
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3 eggs
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest + 2/3 cup lemon juice (about 4 lemons)
- 4 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 8x8 pan with a foil sling.
2. Make the crust by whisking together flour, sugar, and salt. Stir in melted butter. Press mixture into an even layer in the bottom of the pan. Bake until dark golden brown, about 24 minutes.
3. While the crust bakes, whisk sugar, flour, cream of tartar, and salt in the empty bowl. Whisk in eggs and yolks. Whisk in lemon zest and juice. Transfer mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and registers 160°F, about 8 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in butter. For a smoother product, strain mixture back into the bowl, though this is optional and might not be a good idea since it removes the zest.
4. Pour filling over hot crust and tilt pan to spread evenly. Bake until filling is set and barely jiggles when shaken, about 12 minutes.

Let bars cool completely, refrigerate overnight, then cut into bars.
