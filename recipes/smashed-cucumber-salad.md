# Smashed Cucumber Salad

## Ingredients

- 2 English cucumbers
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon chili oil
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- small handful cilantro, roughly chopped
- toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Wrap one of the cucumbers with some plastic to prevent splattering. Use a heavy cleaver or small skillet to smash the cucumber until the skin cracks open and the cucumber splits lengthwise into roughly 4 quarters. Cut into 1 inch pieces. Repeat with the second cucumber.
2. Toss cucumbers with 1/2 teaspoon salt and let drain in a colander for 10 minutes.
3. Mix the rest of the salt, sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and garlic in a bowl. Add the drained cucumbers and toss to coat.

Serve topped with cilantro and sesame seeds.
