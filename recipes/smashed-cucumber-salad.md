# Smashed Cucumber Salad

## Ingredients

- 2 English cucumbers
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon chili oil
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- 1 small bunch cilantro, dried with salad spinner, roughly chopped
- toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Working one cucumber at a time: wrap in plastic to prevent splattering, then smash with skillet or other heavy object until skin cracks open and cucumber splits lengthwise into roughly 4 quarters. Cut into 1 inch pieces.
2. Toss cucumbers with 1/2 teaspoon salt and let sit for at least 10 minutes; longer is better.
3. Mix the rest of the salt, sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and garlic in a bowl.
4. Drain cucumbers in a colander. Optionally dry with salad spinner. Toss the cucumbers in the prepared dressing.

Serve topped with cilantro and sesame seeds.
