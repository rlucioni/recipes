# Palak Dal

## Ingredients

### Lentils

- 1 1/2 cups red lentils, rinsed
- 4 1/2 cups water
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated
- 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 6 ounces (~6 cups) greens (e.g., spinach)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
- cilantro, chopped

### Tadka

- 3 tablespoons ghee or browned butter
- 1 1/2 teaspoons brown mustard seeds
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 15 curry leaves, torn (optional)
- 6 garlic cloves, sliced
- 4 whole dried chiles (e.g., arbol, kashmiri)
- 1 serrano chile, halved lengthwise (optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring water, lentils, ginger, and turmeric to boil in a pot. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until lentils are soft and starting to break down, 15-20 minutes.
2. Whisk lentils until coarsely pureed, about 30 seconds. Keep simmering until lentils have consistency of loose polenta, about 5 minutes more. Stir in greens and salt. Cook until greens are wilted, then cover and reserve.
3. Melt butter in skillet. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Cook, stirring constantly, until seeds sizzle and pop, about 30 seconds. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until onion is just starting to brown. Add curry leaves (if using), garlic, and chiles. Cook, stirring often, until onion and garlic are golden brown.
4. Stir lemon juice into lentils. Taste for seasoning.

Transfer lentils to serving bowl(s) and top with tadka and cilantro.
