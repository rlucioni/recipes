# Bizcochitos

Makes about 50 cookies. Adapted from a [recipe](https://www.newmexicomagazine.org/blog/post/bizcochito-recipe-83756/) from New Mexico Magazine.

## Ingredients

### Cookie dough

- 300 grams [lard](lard.md)
- 2/3 cups sugar
- 2 eggs
- 3 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 1/2 tablespoons whisky or Grand Marnier
- zest of one orange
- 1 tablespoon anise seed, crushed
- 3 1/3 cups flour (400-500 grams, it was closer to 500 grams last time)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Cinnamon sugar topping

- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Using a hand mixer, beat lard and sugar until very fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, followed by the orange juice, liquor, orange zest, and anise seed, beating between each ingredient.
3. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Fold into lard mixture until just combined. The dough should have the texture of pie crust. Adjust as needed with flour or orange juice to achieve the right texture.
4. Working with half the dough at a time, press together into a dough ball and roll out to 1/4 inch thick on a floured surface. Use cookie cutters to cut into cookies.
5. Bake on a silpat-lined baking sheet for 11 minutes or until just barely golden. Be careful not to overcook! In the meantime, mix cinnamon and sugar together in a shallow bowl.
6. Let cookies cool on the pan for a couple minutes before coating with cinnamon sugar. Let cool completely on a wire rack.
