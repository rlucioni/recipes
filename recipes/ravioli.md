# Ravioli

Serves 2

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh or frozen ravioli (e.g., porcini, butternut squash)

## Instructions

1. Shake excess cornmeal off of the ravioli. Cut them apart with a sharp knife.
2. Bring lots of salted water to a boil. Drop ravioli into boiling water. Stir gently so they don't stick. When the water returns to a boil, cook until ravioli are puffy and floating, about 6 minutes.

Fishing the ravioli out with a spider works well.
