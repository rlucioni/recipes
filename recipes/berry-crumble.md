## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375&deg;F.
2. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a food processor. Add butter and process until mixture resembles coarse sand.
3. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl. Add vanilla, egg yolk, and vinegar. Mix with a fork until mixture forms clumps when squeezed. Add more vinegar as necessary.
