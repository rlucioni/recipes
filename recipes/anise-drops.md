# Anise Drops

Relative humidity must be below 50% for these to work! They won't "self-frost" when baked otherwise.

## Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 210 grams sugar
- 210 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 1/2 teaspoons anise seed

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs until frothy. Add sugar gradually, beating continuously. Keep beating at medium-high speed for 5 minutes.
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add dry ingredients to egg and sugar mixture. Beat at medium speed for another 3 minutes.
3. Stir in anise seed. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto parchment-lined baking sheets.
4. Let cookies sit at room temperature, uncovered, for at least 8 hours, up to 24. 
5. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Bake until cookies are a creamy, barely-golden color, about 10 minutes.
6. Remove cookies from oven, wait 5 minutes, then loosen them from the parchment with a spatula. Let them cool completely on the pan.
