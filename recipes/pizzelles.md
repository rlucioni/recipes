# Pizzelles

Makes about 16 cookies (not very many). Usually will want to double.

## Ingredients

- 215 grams flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- pinch of salt
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Heat a nonstick pizzelle iron. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs. Slowly incorporate sugar, mixing until combined. Whisk in vanilla and lemon extracts. Gradually whisk in melted butter until batter is smooth and sugar granules have dissolved.
3. Use a spatula to slowly incorporate dry ingredients until just combined.
4. Pipe or scoop roughly 1 tablespoon (#50 disher) of batter in a circle in the center of each pattern on the pizzelle iron. Close the iron, seal with the clasp, and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to remove the pizzelles, mold into shapes if desired (e.g., upside-down bowl), and move to a wire rack to cool.
