# Blueberry Pie

For a 10" pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 2 1/2 pounds blueberries (defrosted if using frozen)
- 1 lemon, zest and juice
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 2-4 tablespoons minute tapioca, ground (see [here](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/guides/pie-baking/pie-thickener.html) for alternatives)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- egg wash (1 egg beaten with some water) and sugar for topping

## Instructions

1. Roll out one batch of pie crust, put it in the pie plate, and refrigerate.
2. Cook half the blueberries on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Let cool briefly.
3. Preheat oven to 400°F.
4. Stir together blueberries, lemon zest, and lemon juice. In a separate bowl, combine sugar, tapioca, and salt. Sprinkle over the top of the blueberry mixture and stir thoroughly to combine.
5. Roll out top crust. Add filling to prepared pie plate and top with top crust (lattice works well). Leave about 1/2 inch overhang of dough on all sides. Fold this overhang under itself and crimp to seal. If necessary, cut vents in the top crust.
6. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.
7. Bake for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue to bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling and at least 140°F, about 40 more minutes.

Chill pie thoroughly before slicing. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
