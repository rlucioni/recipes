# Garlic Aioli

## Ingredients

- 1 egg yolk
- 4 garlic cloves, grated
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup olive oil

## Instructions

1. Whisk egg yolk, garlic, and salt in a mixing bowl.
2. Whisking constantly, add oil, drop by drop at first. Don't add the oil too quickly or the emulsion will break. Whisk until oil is incorporated and aioli is stiff enough to hold its shape.

If the emulsion breaks, don't panic! Start over with a clean bowl and another egg yolk. Slowly whisk in the broken aioli followed by any remaining oil.
