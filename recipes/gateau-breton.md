# Gateau Breton

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 2/3 cup water
- 1/2 cup dried California apricots, chopped
- 65 grams sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Cake

- 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 175 grams sugar
- 5 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons dark rum
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 285 grams flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Egg Wash

- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Blend water and apricots until smooth. Transfer to skillet and add sugar. Cook over medium heat until puree darkens and gets really thick. A spatula dragged through should leave a distinct trail. Transfer to bowl, stir in lemon juice, and refrigerate until cool, at least 15 minutes.
2. Butter 9" cake pan.
3. Cream butter on medium-high for 1 minute. Add sugar and keep creaming for another 3 minutes. Work in 5 yolks, one at a time. Work in rum and vanilla. Fold in flour and salt.
4. Spread half of batter into an even layer in the greased pan. Freeze 10 minutes to harden.
5. Spread filling in an even layer over chilled batter, leaving a 1-2cm space around the edge (like spreading pizza sauce). Freeze another 10 minutes to harden.
6. Preheat oven to 350°F.
7. Gently spread remaining batter over filling. Brush with egg wash. Score surface with the tines of a fork to make a diamond pattern (e.g., 3 parallel lines about 2cm from edges, turn 45° and repeat).
8. Bake until golden brown and edges of cake start to pull away from sides of pan, about 45 minutes. Let cool in pan about 30 minutes. Run a knife along the edge to loosen, then gently turn out and cool another hour.

Cut with a long serrated knife.
