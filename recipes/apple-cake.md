# Apple Cake

For a 9" cake pan. Adapted from [Chef John's French apple cake](https://www.allrecipes.com/french-apple-cake-recipe-7963451).

## Ingredients

- 3 large baking apples (e.g., Honeycrisp), cubed (should be about 4 cups)
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 stick unsalted butter, softened!
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 3 tablespoons rum
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2-3 tablespoons white sugar, for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Butter cake pan and line with parchment round. Flip parchment to butter both sides.
3. In a bowl, toss cubed apples with apple cider vinegar. Reserve.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, and salt.
5. In another bowl, beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg until fully incorporated and mixture is smooth. Add second egg and repeat. Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and half of flour mixture. When flour disappears, fold in the rest with a spatula.
6. Fold in apples until evenly mixed into batter. Transfer batter to prepared pan, pressing it in firmly and smoothing the top. Sprinkle with sugar.
7. Bake until golden brown and internal temp reaches 200°F, about 45 minutes.
8. Let cake cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Then invert onto a wire rack, put a serving plate on top, and flip it back over.

Optionally, top with powdered sugar or whipped cream.
