# Focaccia

## Ingredients

### Biga

- 2 2/3 ounces water, warmed to 100-110°F
- generous 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 2 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour

### Dough

- 12 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour
- 10 ounces water, warmed to 100-110°F
- generous 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped

## Instructions

1. Mix water and yeast, then stir in flour. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit overnight, 8-24 hours.
2. Stir flour, water, and yeast into the biga. Cover and let rise 15 minutes.
3. Stir 2 teaspoons salt into dough. Cover and let rise 30 minutes.
4. Fold dough over itself by lifting and folding edge toward middle. Turn bowl and repeat for a total of 8 folds. Cover and let rise 30 minutes. Repeat folding and rising two more times for a total of 3 30-minute rises.
5. Put a baking sheet or stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F.
6. Transfer dough to floured surface. Dust with flour and divide in half. Shape pieces into 5-inch rounds by tucking under the edges. Coat 2 9-inch pans (or an 8x8 pan) with 2 tablespoons olive oil each, then sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Place a round in each pan, top side down, slide around to coat with oil, then flip dough over. Cover and let rise 5 minutes.
7. Press dough out to edges of pan. Prick surface of dough with a fork or poke with fingers to pop any large bubbles. Sprinkle with rosemary. Let rest 5-10 minutes.
8. Lower oven temperature to 450°F and place pans on baking stone. Bake until tops are golden brown, about 25-28 minutes. Let pans cool 5 minutes before removing loaves, brushing tops with any oil remaining in pans.

Cool about 30 minutes before serving.
