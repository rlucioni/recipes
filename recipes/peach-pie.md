# Peach Pie

For a 9.5" pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 3 pounds yellow peaches
- zest and juice of 1 small lemon
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons minute tapioca, ground (optional)
- heavy cream and demerara sugar for topping

## Instructions

1. Remove pits from peaches and cut into chunks. Toss with lemon juice, lemon zest, sugars, and salt. Let sit for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
1. Roll out one batch of pie crust, put it in a pie plate, and refrigerate.
1. Roll out the second batch of pie crust. Cut slits to allow steam to escape.
1. Take the pie shell out of the refrigerator. Fill with peaches and use a spoon to nestle all the pieces in.
1. Top with the second batch of crust. Trim the excess dough, leaving about 1/2 inch overhang of dough on all sides. Press the edges together, fold them under, and crimp to seal.
1. Brush with cream and sprinkle with demerara sugar.
1. Bake for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue to bake until the crust is golden brown and the center of the pie registers 160°F, about 30-35 more minutes.

Chill pie thoroughly before slicing. Serve with whipped cream.
