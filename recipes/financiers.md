# Financiers

Yields 12-14 financiers (Gobel 15" x 7" 6-compartment tins)

## Ingredients

- 32 grams all-purpose flour, plus extra for tins
- 170 grams fine almond flour
- 226 grams sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 140 grams (about 10 tablespoons) butter, plus extra for tins
- 170 grams egg whites (about 6 large eggs)
- optional garnishes (sliced almonds, sliced fruit, berries)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Butter tins and sprinkle with flour (or use baking spray).
2. Whisk together flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt.
3. Brown butter and reserve.
4. Add egg whites to dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula until well combined, mashing lumps against side of bowl until mixture is smooth. Stir in browned butter until well combined.
5. Fill tins about 3/4 full with batter. A scooper works well. Top with any garnishes. Bake until edges are well-browned and tops are golden, about 14-15 minutes.
6. Immediately remove from tins by placing a wire rack on top and flipping.

Let cakes cool completely before serving or they won't be crispy! Don't wash the tins, just wipe them out while warm.
