# Financiers

Yields X financiers (Gobel 15" x 7" 6-compartment tins)

Note: season new tins before first use. Preheat oven to 400°F. Apply a thin coat of vegetable shortening to each mold. Invert on a wire rack over a pan. Bake for 20-45 minutes. Wipe away any excess and let cool completely. Repeat 2-3 times. Seasoned tin should have a dark brown or black color.

## Ingredients

- 16 grams all-purpose flour, plus extra for tins
- 85 grams fine almond flour
- 113 grams sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 70 grams (about 5 tablespoons) butter, plus extra for tins
- 85 grams egg whites (3-4 large eggs)
- optional garnishes (sliced almonds, sliced fruit, berries)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter tins and sprinkle with flour (or use baking spray).
2. Whisk together flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt.
3. Brown butter and reserve.
4. Add egg whites to dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula until well combined, mashing lumps against side of bowl until mixture is smooth. Stir in browned butter until well combined.
5. Fill tins about 3/4 full with batter. A scooper works well. Top with any garnishes. Bake until edges are well-browned and tops are golden, about 14 minutes.
6. Immediately remove from tins by placing a wire rack on top and flipping.

Let cakes cool completely before serving or they won't be crispy! Don't wash the tins, just wipe them out while warm.
