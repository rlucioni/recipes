## Ingredients

Dough:
- 130 grams warm water
- 5 grams sugar
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 250 grams flour

Filling option 1:
- 3/4 pound finely chopped meat (pork, shrimp, lamb, etc)
- various fillings (daikon radish, chives, napa cabbage)
- soy sauce, garlic powder, sesame oil, rice wine, ginger, and salt to taste

Filling option 2:
- 3/4 pound finely chopped pork
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

Seasoned water (for filling option 2):
- 120 grams boiling water
- 1 inch piece of ginger, crushed
- 3 scallion whites, crushed
- 2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
- 2 teaspoons fennel seeds
- 2 star anise

## Instructions

1. Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand 10 minutes.
2. Stir yeast mixture into flour in a large bowl and knead for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary until a supple dough forms. Let rise 90 minutes, punching down halfway through.
3. Mix boiled water with ginger, scallions, Sichuan peppercorns, fennel seeds, and star anise pods and steep for 30 minutes. Strain and reserve.
4. Mix together filling ingredients except sesame oil with chopsticks in a circular motion until the meat forms a paste consistency. For filling option 2, slowly add in seasoned water and continue stirring for 5 minutes. Mix in sesame oil. Microwave a small portion to taste and adjust the seasoning. Let rest in the refrigerator until wrapping time.
5. Flour work surface and roll out dough into a large sheet. Tightly roll dough into a log and cut into 8 even pieces. Flatten each piece, tuck the corners into the center, and shape into a ball.
6. Roll out each ball into a 5 inch circle with a wooden dowel, making sure to roll the edges thinner than the center. Fill with about 3 tablespoons of filling and start pleating the edges of the dough in a counterclockwise direction until sealed.
7. Place bao on individual parchment paper squares in a bamboo steamer and proof over warm water for 30 minutes.
8. Heat water under the steamer until steam starts coming out of the basket. Steam for 15 minutes.

If desired, serve with a soy sauce and black vinegar dipping sauce.
