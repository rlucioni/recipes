# Pizza Sauce

Adapted from [Serious Eats' New York Style Pizza Sauce](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza-sauce.html). Yields enough sauce for 2-4 10-inch pizzas.

## Ingredients

- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon marjoram
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2-4 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 anchovy fillet, crumbled Parmesan cheese, or MSG
- 1 teaspoon honey
- splash of balsamic vinegar
- splash of vodka

## Instructions

1. Saute onion in olive oil with some salt until soft. Add oregano, basil, marjoram, and black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned.
2. Add garlic and quickly sizzle, then add tomatoes puree with an immersion blender (not completely smooth).
3. Add tomato paste, anchovy/parmesan/MSG, honey, balsamic vinegar, and vodka. Bring to a simmer, lower heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 2 hours. Bubbles should barely be breaking the surface.

This recipe makes a lot of sauce. It freezes well!
