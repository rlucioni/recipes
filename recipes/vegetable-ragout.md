# Vegetable Ragout

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds dry heirloom beans, soaked overnight in salted water (put in fridge if more than 8 hours)
- 3-4 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 pound oyster mushrooms, separated
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 bunches rainbow chard, stems and leaves separated and chopped
- 8-10 garlic scapes, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 3 cups water or stock
- 6 Yukon gold potatoes, cubed
- red wine, apple cider, or sherry vinegar (optional, to taste)

## Instructions

1. Drain and rinse soaked beans. In a pot, combine the beans, rosemary, bay leaf, and enough (salted!) water to cover by a few inches. Simmer, partially covered, until beans are almost tender, 60-90 minutes. Drain and reserve.
2. In the same pot, saute mushrooms with some salt until mostly dry. Add onion, chard stems, and garlic scapes along with some olive oil and saute until softened.
3. Add garlic and cook briefly until fragrant. Stir in the beans and water.
4. Scatter the potatoes on top of the ragout and cover. Steam the potatoes until tender, 20-25 minutes. Then stir in chard leaves and cook, covered, until everything is melded together and tender, up to 15 minutes more.

Before serving, season to taste with salt snd pepper, and stir in 1-2 tablespoons of vinegar. Serve with bread or over rice.
