# Egg Tarts

## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons sugar
- 1 cup hot water
- 1/2 cup evaporated milk, room temperature
- 3 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 package puff pastry, defrosted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Dissolve sugar into hot water. Allow mixture to cool slightly.
3. Whisk together evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla. Gradually whisk in the warm sugar syrup.
4. Roll out the puff pastry to about 5mm thick. Cut into 4" diameter circles. Gently fit the circles into the cups of a standard muffin pan, leaving a lip going over the top of the cup to account for shrinkage during baking. Dock with a fork.
5. Fill the shells about 3/4 full with custard.
6. Transfer pan to oven, lower heat to 350°F, and bake until filling is just set, about 26 minutes.
