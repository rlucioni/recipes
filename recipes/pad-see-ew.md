# Pad See Ew

Adapted from Hot Thai Kitchen's [Pad See Ew](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/pad-see-ew-new/). Serves 2.

## Ingredients

### Sauce

- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce (it helps to oil the measuring spoon first)
- 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon Chinese black soy sauce

### Everything Else
- 1 pound fresh wide rice noodles or 8 ounces dried (if using dried, soak in room temperature water for 1 hour)
- 8 ounces shrimp
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 4 eggs
- 4-6 stalks (150 g) Chinese broccoli, stems thinly sliced on a bias, leaves roughly chopped
- 4 teaspoons sugar
- ground white pepper, to taste
- prik nam som

## Instructions

1. Combine all sauce ingredients and mix well. Reserve.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet. Sear shrimp until just cooked through. Reserve.
3. Add more oil if necessary. At this point, stir fry one serving at a time. Sizzle half of the garlic for a few seconds before adding half of the gai lan. Stir fry until wilted.
4. Move gai lan to the size and add more oil to the middle of the pan. Add in 2 eggs. Break up to scramble, then stir into the gai lan.
5. Add half of the noodles, half of the sauce, and half of the sugar. Stir fry until noodles have absorbed the sauce.
6. Spread out noodles and let sit for 30 seconds to char noodles. Flip and char other side.
7. Mix in half of the reserved shrimp.
8. Serve and repeat with the other half of all the ingredients.

Serve topped with white pepper with prik nam som on the side.
