Yields 24 cookies

## Ingredients

- 2 cups slivered almonds
- 3/4 cup cream
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup orange marmalade
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- zest of 1 orange
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- pinch of instant espresso powder (optional)
- pinch of salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F on convection. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silpats.
2. Process almonds until they look like coarse sand, about 30 seconds.
3. Bring cream, butter, and sugar to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture starts to brown and is thick enough that it leaves a trail that doesn't fill in immediately, 6-8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in almonds, marmalade, flour, vanilla, orange zest, and salt.
4. Drop 6 tablespoon-size balls of dough onto baking sheets. Lightly press them into 2" circles.
5. Bake until dark brown, about 14 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway.
6. Move cookies, still on pan liner, to counter to cool for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a cooling rack and make next batch.
7. Microwave 3 ounces chocolate in 15 second intervals until melted. Stir in remaining ounce, instant espresso powder, and salt. Paint on bottom of cookies or drizzle on top.
