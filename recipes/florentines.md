# Florentines

Yields 24 cookies

## Ingredients

### Cookies

- 2 cups slivered almonds
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup orange marmalade
- zest of 1 orange
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup cream
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- 1/2 cup sugar

### Chocolate feet

- 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (not chocolate chips since they won't temper properly)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F on convection. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silpats.
2. Process almonds until they look like coarse sand, about 30 seconds. Dump into a bowl, mix in flour and salt, and reserve.
3. Prep the marmalade, orange zest, and vanilla. Reserve.
4. Bring cream, butter, and sugar to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture starts to brown and is thick enough that it leaves a trail that doesn't fill in immediately, 6-8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in reserved ingredients (almonds, flour, salt, marmalade, orange zest, and vanilla).
5. Drop 6 tablespoon-size balls of dough onto baking sheets. Lightly press them into 2" circles.
6. Bake until nicely browned, about 12-14 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway.
7. Let cookies cool on the pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a cooling rack and make next batch.
8. Microwave 3 parts chocolate in 15 second intervals until melted. Stir in 1 part unmelted chocolate to temper the chocolate. Spread on bottom of cookies and set aside to harden.
