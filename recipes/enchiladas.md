## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Toast anchos in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer anchos to microwave-safe bowl, add broth, and microwave for 2 minutes, covered. Let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer anchos and broth to blender along with minced chipotle.
3. Saute onions with some oil and salt until softened. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Reserve half of onion mixture in large bowl. Return remaining onion mixture to medium heat and add tomato paste and cumin. Cook, stirring frequently, until tomato paste darkens, about 5 minutes. Transfer to blender. Process until smooth. Salt to taste.
4. Toast cumin and coriander in oil for a few minutes. Add chicken and toss to coat. Move to bowl with reserved onions. Add 3/4 (6 ounces) cheese, cilantro, and 1/4 cup sauce. Stir to combine. Salt to taste.
5. Lightly coat tortillas with oil and toast in oven until warm, about 5 minutes. Spread 1/2 cup sauce in bottom of skillet. Fill each tortilla with about 1/4 cup filling, rolling tightly and placing in skillet seam-side down. Spread remaining sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake until cheese is browned and sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes.

Let cool for 10 minutes before serving topped with green onion and cilantro, with sour cream and lime on the side.
