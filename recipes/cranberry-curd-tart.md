# Cranberry Curd Tart

Requires 9" tart pan with removable bottom

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 455 grams cranberries, fresh or frozen
- 240 grams sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- pinch of salt
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 4 tablespoons butter, cut into 4 pieces and softened

### Crust

- 115 grams almond flour
- 60 grams cornstarch
- 65 grams sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted
- 3/4 teaspoon almond extract

## Stabilized cream

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons of filling
- 1 tablespoon sugar

## Instructions

1. Bring cranberries, sugar, water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan, stirring occasionally. Simmer covered until cranberries burst and shrivel, about 10 minutes.
2. Whisk together egg yolks and cornstarch. When cranberries are ready, transfer them to a food processor, add yolk mixture, then process until smooth. Let mixture cool in food processor until skin forms and mixture reaches 120-125°F, about 45-60 minutes. Make crust while mixture cools.
3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk together almond flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt. With a spatula, work in melted butter and almond extract until dough forms.
4. Crumble 2/3rds of dough into bottom of tart pan and press to even thickness. Crumble remaining dough around the sides and press sides to even thickness. Put pan on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
5. Add softened butter to cranberry puree and process until smooth. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Make stabilized cream, refrigerate, then transfer remaining filling into crust, even if it's still warm.
6. Let tart sit at room temperature for 4 hours before serving or refrigerating.

Serve day of or make ahead by up to several days. Wait until serving to whip and top with stabilized cream. Crust softens over time.
