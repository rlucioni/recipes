- 1 onion, finely chopped

- 8 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 1/2 teaspoon chile flakes or more, to taste

## Instructions

1. Steam the crabs and/or lobsters. Let cool and cut/crack into manageable pieces.
2. Peel and devein shrimp. Reserve shrimp meat. Make shrimp stock by toasting shells in olive oil until fragrant before adding 4 cups water and simmering for 7 minutes. Strain and reserve.
3. Sweat onion and fennel in a generous amount of olive oil and a big pinch of salt until soft. Add garlic and chile flakes and sweat for another minute.
4. Add white wine and simmer until the alcohol is cooked off. Add pureed tomatoes and sugar. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.
5. Add enough reserved shrimp stock until broth reaches desired consistency. Bring back to a simmer. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
6. Add in clams, fish, shrimp, and mussels. Cover and poach gently for 3 minutes.
7. Add in crab and/or lobster pieces. Cover and poach for another 3 minutes. Check that the shellfish are open and everything is cooked through.

Ladle into bowls and top with chopped herbs, along with a drizzle of nice olive oil. Serve with crusty bread (drizzle thick slices of bread with olive oil and cook in a 400Â°F convection roast oven for 5-7 minutes or until golden brown).
