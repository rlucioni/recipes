# Pumpkin Puree

## Ingredients

- 1 sugar pumpkin, halved, seeds and pulp removed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F on convection roast.
2. Put pumpkin halves cut-side down on a lined baking sheet. Roast until it can be easily pierced, about 30 minutes. Turn halves over and roast until very soft, 15-30 more minutes.
3. Scoop flesh from skins and puree in a food processor until smooth. Drain in a strainer set over a bowl for about 1 hour.

Can be substituted for an equal amount of canned puree.
