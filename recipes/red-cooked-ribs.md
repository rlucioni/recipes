- 2 teaspoons hoisin sauce
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- splash of Xiaoxing wine or sherry

## Instructions

1. Vigorously boil ribs in a pot for 3 minutes to remove the scum. Strain and reserve ribs and clean the pot.
2. Heat some oil in the pot on medium heat. Add aromatics and spices and cook until fragrant.
3. Add hoisin and sizzle for a few seconds before adding the liquids.
4. Add the ribs to the pot and arrange into a single layer. Add enough water to cover ribs halfway.
5. Simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes, turning the ribs halfway through.
6. Remove ribs to a serving bowl. Skim fat from the sauce and strain sauce into the serving bowl. Top with scallions.

Serve with rice.
