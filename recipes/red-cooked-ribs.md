# Red Cooked Ribs

## Ingredients

- 1 rack ribs, cut into small-ish pieces
- 1 nub ginger, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 heaven-facing chilies
- 3 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 pound king oyster mushrooms, 1-inch chunks (optional)
- 2 star anise
- 1/2 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 red cardamom pod
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 cup Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- 1 1/2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons black vinegar

## Instructions

1. Add ribs to a Dutch oven, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil vigorously 2-3 minutes to remove scum. Strain, clean pot, and rinse ribs.
2. Heat oil in pot on medium heat. Add ginger, garlic, chilies, white parts of the scallions, mushrooms, and spices. Cook until fragrant.
3. Add sugar and stir until starting to melt. Add ribs and stir.
4. Add wine, soy sauces, vinegar, and enough water to barely cover the ribs.
5. Simmer, covered, for 30-45 minutes. Stir every 15 minutes or so.
6. Remove ribs and fish out other stuff, leaving only sauce in the pot. Reduce to desired consistency. Add green parts of scallions, boil briefly, and serve.

Serve with rice.
