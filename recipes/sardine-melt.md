# Sardine Melt

Inspired by the tuna melt at the Palace Diner in Biddeford, Maine.

## Ingredients

- sourdough sandwich bread, toasted
- mayonnaise
- iceberg lettuce, cut into thick slices
- sardines
- bread and butter pickles
- mild cheddar slices (or other cheese that melts well)

## Instructions

1. Spread mayo on both sides.
2. Build up one side with lettuce slice, sardines, shingled pickles, and cheese slice, positioned so it secures everything when it melts.
3. Melt cheese under the broiler. Close up.
