# Chocolate Ice Cream

Yields 1 1/2 quarts.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon espresso powder
- 6 ounces 70% chocolate, chopped
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Whisk cream, cocoa powder, and espresso powder in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and simmer 30 seconds, whisking constantly.
2. Transfer to a large bowl, add chopped chocolate, and whisk until smooth.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks.
4. In the same saucepan as before, whisk together milk, sugar, and salt over medium heat.
5. Once the milk mixture is steaming, add a ladle to the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine. Add the milk/egg mixture back into the saucepan, whisking constantly.
6. Continue to cook the custard over medium heat, stirring constantly with a spatula, until it reaches 170Â°F. It should be slightly thickened and coat the back of the spatula.
7. Pour the thickened custard through a fine-mesh strainer into the bowl with the chocolate mixture. Add the vanilla and whisk to combine.
8. Let cool to room temperature and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
9. Churn in an ice cream maker until thick, about 20 minutes.
10. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours until firm.
