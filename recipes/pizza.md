# Pizza

## Ingredients

- [pizza dough](pizza-dough.md)
- [pizza sauce](pizza-sauce.md), [simple pizza sauce](simple-pizza-sauce.md), or [pesto](pesto.md)
- grated full-fat, low-moisture mozzarella cheese
- toppings as desired (e.g., sausage, peppers, onions, artichokes, pepperoni, pineapple, Canadian bacon)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 550Â°F, or as high as it'll go. If using a steel, preheat for 1 hour.
2. Gently press out dough ball into a disc. If using a steel, build on a peel (e.g., parchment round on baking sheet). Also works in a 10" cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of olive oil in it (thicker crust).
3. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings. Go light if using a steel and making a thinner crust.
4. Bake for 5-6 minutes if using steel. 15 minutes if using cast iron skillet.

Top with torn basil.
