# Strawberry Rhubarb Pie

For a 10" pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 1 1/2 pounds strawberries, halved or quartered
- 1 pound rhubarb, diced
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 7 tablespoons minute tapioca, ground
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Roll out one batch of pie crust, put it in the pie plate, and refrigerate.
2. Cook down (most to all of) the strawberries on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Let cool briefly.
3. Preheat oven to 400°F.
4. Combine strawberries and rhubarb in a bowl. If necessary, add a few more strawberries until the ratio looks right. Mix sugar and tapioca together and fold gently into the strawberries and rhubarb. Let rest 15-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Transfer fruit and any juices into reserved crust.
6. Roll out remaining crust and use it to seal the pie, trimming and crimping the edges. Brush with cream and sprinkle with sugar.
7. Bake for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue to bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling and at least 140°F, about 40 more minutes.

Chill pie thoroughly before slicing. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
