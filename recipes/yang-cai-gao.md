## Ingredients

- 1 small handful dried red algae for agar
- 8 cups water
- turbinado sugar

## Instructions

1. Rinse algae. Add to a slow cooker with water and simmer with the lid on for at least 6 hours.
2. Strain into a large bowl using a coffee filter or cheese cloth and allow to sit undisturbed for at least 4 hours or until set. If the bowl is moved or bumped during this time, the jelly will not set properly.
3. Once set, eat immediately or refrigerate before serving.
4. Right before serving, make a simple syrup using equal parts sugar and water. In a separate bowl, mix some water with a few drops of mint extract.

Serve by spooning into bowls and topping with syrup and mint.
