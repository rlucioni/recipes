# Tomato Soup

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 bay leaf
- 3/4 cup water
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Sweat onions in olive oil over medium heat. Add a pinch of salt to bring out liquid.
2. When onions soften, use a slotted spoon to add about two-thirds of the whole tomatoes, reserving the tomato juice. Break up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon and add the bay leaf, tomato paste, and brown sugar.
3. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated and the tomatoes start to caramelize, about 15 minutes.
4. Add flour and continue to cook for 2 minutes.
5. Add in the remaining tomatoes and tomato juice. Rinse out the cans with 3/4 cup water and add to the soup. Add baking soda and salt and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Turn off the heat, remove the bay leaf, and use an immersion blender to blend the mixture into a smooth puree.
7. Stir in cream and season to taste.

Garnish with fresh basil. Pairs well with grilled cheese sandwiches!
