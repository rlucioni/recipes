# Brownies

For an 8x8 pan

## Ingredients

- 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, cut into quarters
- 3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder
- 1 1/2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 3 eggs
- 1 1/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 5 ounces all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Make a foil sling in the pan by laying 2 sheets of foil perpendicular to each other with extra foil hanging over the sides. Lightly oil and set aside.
2. Melt chocolates and butter in bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring until smooth. Whisk in cocoa powder and instant espresso powder until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.
3. Whisk together eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a separate bowl. Whisk in warm chocolate mixture. Fold in flour until just combined. Transfer to prepared pan, using a spatula to spread it out.
4. Bake until a toothpick comes out mostly clean, about 40 minutes.

Let cool (about 2 hours) before cutting into squares. Store at room temperature in airtight container, or freeze.
