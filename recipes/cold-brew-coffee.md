# Cold Brew Coffee

## Ingredients

- 100 grams coarsely ground coffee (30 on an Encore burr grinder)
- 800 grams cold water

## Instructions

1. Pour water over grounds. Optional: for a final product with more acidity, like iced coffee, bloom 1 minute with 467 grams boiling water, then add the rest. Stir, cover, and allow to steep in the fridge for 24 hours.
2. Filter grounds from coffee and refrigerate. A Chemex filter works great!

To serve, combine with ice and whole milk or half-and-half. Brewed 1:8, should be diluted to around 1:16.
