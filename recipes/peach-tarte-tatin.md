# Peach Tarte Tatin

## Ingredients

- 1 batch [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 pounds ripe but firm peaches, peeled, pitted, and quartered
- 1 tablespoon bourbon
- cream for topping

## Instructions

1. Roll out pie crust to 10" round. Transfer to inverted baking sheet with parchment or Silpat on top. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough under itself and pinch to create 9" round with raised rim. Cut 3 2" slits in center of dough and refrigerate.
2. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
3. Smear butter across bottom of 10" oven-safe skillet. Sprinkle 1/2 cup sugar over butter, shaking to distribute evenly. Sprinkle salt over sugar.
4. Layer peaches in circular pattern around edge of skillet, packing fruit tightly. Tuck remaining peaches in center, squeezing in as much fruit as possible.
5. Cook over high heat without stirring until sugar dissolves, juice is released, and it starts to caramelize, about 10-12 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
6. Place crust on top of peaches. Brush lightly with water and sprinkle over remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.
7. Bake on middle rack until crust is well browned, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes.
8. Put inverted plate on top of crust. With one hand firmly securing plate, carefully tip skillet over bowl to drain any juice. Return skillet to wire rack, remove plate, and shake skillet firmly to redistribute peaches. Invert still-hot tart onto plate, then slide tart onto wire rack.
9. Pour juice into now-empty skillet. Stir in bourbon and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is dark, thick, and just starting to smoke, 2 to 3 minutes. Return reduction to bowl and let cool until consistency of honey, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush reduction over peaches. Let tart cool for at least another 20 minutes.

Slide off wire rack, cut into wedges, and serve with whipped cream.
