# Thumbprint Cookies

## Ingredients

### Cookies

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 360 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/3 - 1/2 cup jam

### Glaze (optional)

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
- 2-3 teaspoons water

## Instructions

1. Cream together butter and sugar (hand mixer works well).
2. Add yolks, vanilla, and salt. Beat until well combined.
3. Gradually add in flour until just combined.
4. Working one at a time: scoop dough into tablespoon-sized ball, rolling smooth (and optionally rolling in sugar), then (while ball is still warm) gently flatten and press a cavity into it, pressing any cracks back together. Freeze for 30 minutes or refrigerate for 1 hour.
5. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
6. Fill each cookie with about 1/4 teaspoon jam.
7. Bake until edges start to turn golden brown, about 12-14 minutes.

If glazing, stir together powdered sugar, almond extract, and water to make a thin glaze. Drizzle over cooled cookies; cutting the corner off a Ziploc bag works well. Allow icing to harden before eating!
