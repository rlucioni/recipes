# Acquacotta

## Ingredients

### Sofrito

- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 celery ribs, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
- 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 3/4 teaspoon salt

### The rest

- 8 cups chicken broth or water
- 1 fennel bulb, halved, cored, and diced, 2 tablespoons fronds minced
- 30 ounces cannellini beans, drained with liquid reserved
- 1 head escarole or kale, trimmed, washed, and roughly chopped
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/2 cup parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh oregano, minced (not the same as dry!)
- Pecorino or Parmesan cheese, rind cut off and reserved (optional)

## Instructions

1. Pulse onion, celery, and garlic in food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to pot. Add tomatoes to processor and pulse until tomatoes are finely chopped. Reserve.
2. Stir oil and salt into onion mixture. Cook over medium-high heat until fond starts to form on bottom of pot. Stir in tomatoes, then cook until mixture is thick enough to leave a trail when dragged. Stir often to prevent burning.
3. Add chicken broth and fennel bulb to pot. Add cheese rind, if using. Simmer until fennel softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in beans and escarole. Cook until fennel is tender, about 10 minutes.
4. Whisk egg yolks into reserved bean liquid, then stir into soup (prevents scrambling). Stir in parsley, oregano, and fennel fronds. Season to taste.

Top with grated cheese and serve with bread on the side (or as croutons).
