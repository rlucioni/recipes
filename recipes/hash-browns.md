# Hash Browns

Adapted from [Serious Eats' hash browns](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/06/shredded-hash-browns-recipe.html).

## Ingredients

- 1 large Russet potato
- salt
- oil

## Instructions

1. Peel potato and grate using the large holes in a box grater.
2. Toss with some salt and allow to drain in a colander for 15 minutes.
3. Squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the potatoes, one handful at a time. Place on a paper towel-lined plate in a thin layer.
4. Microwave on high for 2 minutes.
5. Heat oil in a non-stick skillet. Add potatoes and cook over medium heat until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side.

Let cool on cooling rack. You can make many of these in advance by freezing after microwaving. Fry straight from the freezer!
