# Tomato Tart

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds plum or Roma tomatoes, cored and halved lengthwise, seeds and jelly removed
- 1/3 cup sherry vinegar
- 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 shallot, finely diced.
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 teaspoons minced thyme
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. In a 10-inch oven-safe skillet, combine vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer until it reaches the consistency of maple syrup, about 2 minutes. Add shallot, butter, and thyme.
3. Kill the heat, add the tomatoes, and toss them in the caramel. Orient tomatoes cut-side up. Sprinke with a little more salt and pepper, then roast in oven until caramelized, about 1 hour.
4. While tomatoes are in the oven, prep the puff pastry. Goal is to cut a 10-inch circle out of it. Flour the dough, roll it out a bit, and trace around a 10-inch plate. Chill dough round in the fridge to firm it back up.
5. Take tomatoes out of the oven, lay puff pastry round over the top, then back in the oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
6. Let pan cool 10-15 minutes. Turn out onto a plate, using a paring knife to loosen the edges first, if necessary. Transfer to cutting board and let cool another 10-15 minutes.

Finish with minced thyme and/or alyssum flowers.
