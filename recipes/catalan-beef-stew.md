# Catalan-Style Beef Stew

Serves 6.

## Ingredients

### Stew
- 2 large onions, finely chopped
- 1/2 pound oyster mushrooms, cut into large pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 14 1/2 ounces crushed tomatoes (canned or fresh)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cups dry white wine
- 1 cup water
- 1 large sprig thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs, trimmed and cut into 2‑inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar

### Picada
- 1/4 cup blanched almonds
- 1 slice hearty white bread (crust removed, torn into 1‑inch pieces)
- 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 3 tablespoons parsley, minced

## Instructions
1. In a large oven-safe pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add onions, mushrooms, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until deeply caramelized (about 30 minutes). Fish out and reserve mushroom pieces.
2. Preheat oven to 300°F. Stir in tomatoes, smoked paprika, and bay leaves. Cook 5–10 minutes until thickened.
3. Add wine, water, thyme, cinnamon, and beef. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then transfer uncovered to the oven. Cook 3 hours, or until fork tender, stirring halfway through.
5. For the picada, toast almonds until golden (3–6 minutes) and transfer to a food processor. In the same skillet, toast the bread until crisp (2–4 minutes) and add to the food processor, along with the garlic. Process for ~20 seconds until fine. Stir in parsley and reserve.
6. When beef is tender, remove the bay leaves and stir in the picada, mushrooms, and sherry vinegar. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Serve with rice, potatoes, or noodles.
