# Kuzukiri

Adapted from Cooking with Dog's [kuzukiri and kuromitsu syrup](https://cookingwithdog.com/recipe/kuzukiri/). Serves 2.

## Ingredients

### Kuzukiri

- 50 grams kuzu starch
- 150 grams water

### Kuromitsu syrup

- 125 grams kurozato, muscovado, or brown sugar
- 125 grams chuzarato, demerara, or granulated sugar
- 125 grams water

## Instructions

1. Mix sugars and water in saucepan over low heat, stirring often. When sugar is completely dissolved, reserve.
2. Whisk kuzu starch and water. Strain, whisk again, and pour onto shallow cooking tray. Kuzu should be about 2mm thick.
3. Float tray on boiling water. Shake gently with tongs to even out. When surface firms up and becomes translucent, submerge tray until kuzu is clear, about 15 seconds.
4. Submerge tray in ice water. Once cooled, gently scrape kuzu off tray. Holding middle of both edges, move kuzu sheet to cutting board, folding it in half. Slice into 1cm strips.

Serve strips in bowls of ice water with syrup in a bowl on the side. Don't overchill or kuzu will turn white and texture won't be as good.
