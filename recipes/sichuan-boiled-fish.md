# Sichuan Boiled Fish

Inspired by the Sichuan-style sliced fish at Gourmet Dumpling House in Boston.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound flaky, white fish (e.g., tilapia, catfish, flounder, carp), filleted
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry), divided
- 1 egg white
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 5 cups water (and some chicken bouillon)
- 1 nub ginger, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- 3 scallions, cut into large pieces
- 3/4 pound soybean sprouts
- napa cabbage, coarsely chopped
- 1 batch [chili oil](chili-oil.md)

## Instructions

1. Slice fish into 1/4-inch slices at a 45-degree angle.
2. Mix salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon rice wine. Add egg white, mix, then incorporate cornstarch. Add fish slices, toss, drizzle 1 tablespoon oil on the surface, then cover with plastic wrap. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
3. Bring water, bouillon, ginger, garlic, scallions, and 1 tablespoon rice wine to a boil. Add salt to taste. Add bean sprouts and napa, return to a boil, and cook for 1 minute. Kill heat and remove all solids with a spider, reserving to a heat-proof serving bowl.

5. Finish chili oil, then drizzle over serving bowl.
