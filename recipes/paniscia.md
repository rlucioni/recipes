# Paniscia

## Ingredients

- 2-3 ounces pancetta, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 celery ribs, chopped
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 6 ounces salami or soppressata, 1/4-inch dice
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 6 garlic cloves, grated
- 1 cup dry red wine (something from the Piedmont region is ideal)
- 4 cups water (or chicken broth)
- 1 green cabbage, halved, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (~4 cups)
- 1 pound dried [beans](beans.md), cooked separately
- 2 cups bean cooking water
- 1 ounce Parmesan, grated
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
- parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Brown pancetta with some oil in a pot. Add onion, carrots, celery. Saute with some salt until softened.
2. Add rice and salami. Briefly toast rice until translucent around edges, about 3 minutes.
3. Stir in tomato paste and garlic. Add wine and cook until absorbed, about 3 minutes. Add water. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring halfway.
4. Stir in cabbage. Keep simmering, covered, until most liquid has been absorbed and rice is al dente, about 6-9 minutes.
5. Add beans and 1 cup bean cooking water. Stir constantly until creamy, about 3 minutes. Kill heat and stir in Parmesan and butter. Add extra bean cooking water to thin, as desired. Remember it will thicken a lot when cooled! Stir in vinegar and season to taste.

Top with parsley when serving.
