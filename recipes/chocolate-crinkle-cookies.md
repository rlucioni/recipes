# Chocolate Crinkle Cookies

Makes 22 cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup (1 1/2 ounces) unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-processed is ideal)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups packed (10 1/2 ounces) brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 4 teaspoons instant espresso powder (optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 325°F.
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl.
3. Separately, whisk brown sugar, eggs, espresso powder (if using), and vanilla together in large bowl.
4. Microwave chocolate and butter in bowl, stirring occasionally until melted.
5. Whisk chocolate mixture into wet ingredients until combined. Fold in dry ingredients until no dry streaks remain. Let dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
6. Fill shallow dishes or plates with the granulated and powdered sugars. Working with about 2 tablespoons of dough at a time, roll into a ball, drop into granulated sugar and roll to coat, then transfer to powdered sugar and roll to coat. Space evenly on cookie sheet.
5. Bake until puffed, cracked, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft (should look raw between cracks), about 12 minutes.

Let cool completely before serving.
