Serves 6

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh chorizo
- 1 large onion, chopped
- (optional) other diced vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, bell peppers, or carrots

## Instructions

1. Break up chorizo and cook in a pot until browned. Reserve.

3. Add garlic and paprika. Sizzle for 30 seconds.
4. Add tomatoes, chicken stock, beans, and reserved chorizo. Bring to a simmer.
5. Add kale and continue simmering for 20 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender.
