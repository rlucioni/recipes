# Falafel

Adapted from Chef John's [falafel](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/03/falafel-opposite-of-how-these-will-make.html).

## Ingredients

### Falafel

- 8 ounces dried chickpeas
- 3/4 cup cilantro
- 3/4 cup parsley
- 1/2 onion, chopped fine
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup water
- 2 teaspoons baking powder

### Tahini sauce

- 1/3 cup tahini
- 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1/4 cup lemon juice (about 1-2 lemons)

## Instructions

1. Soak garbanzo beans overnight.
2. To make the tahini sauce, mix tahini, yogurt, and lemon juice in a bowl. Thin with water until it has the desired consistency and season to taste with salt. Reserve.
3. Add cilantro, parsley, onion, garlic, spices, and salt to a food processor. Process for 5 seconds, or until it resembles pesto.
4. Add chickpeas and pulse 12 times, scraping down the bowl halfway through. The chickpeas should be chopped, not pureed.
5. Whisk flour and 1/3 cup water in bowl until no lumps remain. Microwave, whisking every 10 seconds, until mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency, 40 to 80 seconds. Stir in baking powder.
6. Combine chickpea mixture and flour paste in a large bowl and mix well. Form into balls using a #30 scooper (or two generous tablespoons). The recipe should yield about 24 balls. Alternatively, form into patties and pan-fry.
7. Fry in 325Â°F oil for about 5 minutes, or until crispy and floating.

Serve immediately with tahini sauce in a pita.
