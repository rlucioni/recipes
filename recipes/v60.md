# V60

Yields 2 cups

## Ingredients

- 30 grams coffee, ground finer side of medium
- 500 grams boiling water, plus extra for rinsing filter

## Instructions

1. Rinse filter and preheat brewer. Discard water.
2. Pour ground coffee into the filter. Make small well with finger.
3. Bloom. Gently pour about 60g water. Swirl to agitate grounds for even saturation. Bloom for 30-45 seconds.
4. Pour rest of water in two phases. First, try to get to 60% of brew weight (300g) in next 30 seconds (by 1:15). Don't be overly aggressive. Try to add remaining water in the next 30 seconds, adding a little at a time to keep cone close to full (retain thermal mass).
5. Stir with spoon to knock down any stuck grounds. Optionally, give a final swirl to produce flat bed.
