# Squash Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 squash (e.g., zucchini), about 250 grams, grated
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 eggs
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour

## Instructions

1. In a big bowl, mix grated squash with salt. Let sit 15 minutes.
2. Mix in eggs, green onion, white pepper, sesame oil, sugar, and flour. The batter should have the consistency of regular pancake batter; add more flour if too thin.
3. Heat a small amount of oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. Ladle in some batter and cook each side until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat until you've used all the batter.

Serve with a soy sauce, black vinegar, and chili oil dipping sauce.
