# Sangria

## Ingredients

- 2 juice oranges, one sliced and one juiced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup Grand Marnier
- 750 ml bottle dry Spanish red wine (e.g., Tempranillo, Garnacha)

## Instructions

1. Add sliced orange, lemon, and sugar to pitcher. Mash with wooden spoon until the fruit releases some juice but isn't totally crushed and the sugar dissolves.
2. Stir in orange juice, Grand Marnier, and wine. Refrigerate for a few hours.

You can add some ice before serving. It also helps to stir to distribute settled fruit and pulp. The longer sangria sits before drinking, the smoother it tastes. A full day is ideal, but if that's not possible give it at least two hours to sit.
