# Pumpkin Pie

Adapted from [Chef John's pumpkin pie](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/11/best-pumpkin-pie-ever-come-for-pie-stay.html).

## Ingredients

- 1 batch [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 15 ounces canned or homemade [pumpkin puree](pumpkin-puree.md)
- 14 ounces canned sweetened condensed milk
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon Chinese five spice
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F.
2. Roll out pie crust and place in pie dish (the filling fits better in a shallower 9" pie dish).
3. Add all remaining ingredients to a bowl and whisk until smooth. If using previously-frozen homemade puree, remember to pour off any extra water that came out while defrosting!
4. Pour filling into crust and bake for 15 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to 365°F and bake until internal temp registers 175°F, about 35-40 minutes. Keep an eye on the crust. You might need to put a foil ring on it about halfway through to keep it from burning.

Cool to room temperature and chill pie before slicing. Serve with freshly whipped cream.
