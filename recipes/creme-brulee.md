# Creme Brulee

Makes 6 servings.

## Ingredients

- 2 2/3 cups heavy cream, or substitute up to 50% whole milk for a lighter custard
- 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
- pinch of salt
- 5 egg yolks
- 1/2 cup sugar, plus more for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. Bring some water to a boil for the water bath.
3. Heat cream, vanilla, and salt until almost simmering. Remove from heat and let steep for 15 minutes.
4. Beat egg yolks and sugar until light in color right before the 15 minutes are up. Add hot cream mixture immediately and whisk to combine.
5. Strain to remove the vanilla pod and any fibrous bits.
