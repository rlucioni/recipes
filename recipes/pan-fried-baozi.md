# Pan Fried Baozi

Yields 16

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 250 grams warm water
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- pinch of sugar
- 500 grams flour

### Filling

- napa cabbage, salted and drained
- Chinese chives, finely chopped
- 2 pounds ground pork
- 1 pound shrimp, chopped fine
- soy sauce

- garlic powder
- white pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine water, yeast, and sugar in a small bowl. Make sure the yeast is alive.
2. Stir yeast mixture into flour in a large bowl and knead for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary until a supple dough forms. If kneading with a machine and dough hook, knead on speed 2 for 2 minutes at a time, 4-6 minutes total. Lightly oil, then let rise 1 hour.
3. While dough is rising, thoroughly combine all filling ingredients. Microwave a small patty to check for seasoning.
4. Roll dough balls into discs. Fill, then close by pleating sides together, leaving an opening in the top. Proof 30 minutes.
5. Steam-fry in vegetable oil and water, covered, until water is gone and bottoms are golden brown, about 6-7 minutes on medium heat (5).
