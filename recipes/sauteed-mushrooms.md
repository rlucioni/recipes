# Sauteed Mushrooms

Same technique can be used for many different kinds of mushrooms (e.g., chanterelles, morels, etc.)

## Ingredients

- 1 pound mushrooms, thoroughly washed
- pinch of salt
- 4 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Cook mushrooms over medium-high heat with a pinch of salt until they release their moisture and most of it evaporates. Can cover with lid to kick-start the process.
2. Once the pan is mostly dry, add butter and continue to cook until the mushrooms brown.
