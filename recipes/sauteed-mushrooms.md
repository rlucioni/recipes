## Ingredients

- 1 pound mushrooms
- 1/4 cup water

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 shallot, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, minced
- 1/4 cup red wine

1. Cook mushrooms and water, stirring occasionally until skillet is almost dry and mushrooms begin to sizzle, 4-8 minutes. Reduce heat, add oil, and cook until mushrooms are browned, 4-8 minutes longer.
2. Melt in butter, then add shallot, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Sizzle briefly, then add wine and vinegar, if using. Cook until liquid has mostly evaporated, 2-3 minutes.
