For a 9x3 round cake pan. Inspired by Santiago Rivera's [tarta de queso](https://www.lavanguardia.com/comer/sitios/20181026/452544579597/mejor-tarta-queso-espana-receta-la-vina.html) at La Viña in San Sebastián, Spain.

- 1 1/3 cups sugar
- 6 eggs
- 1 cup cream
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line greased cake pan with parchment paper, leaving some hanging over sides.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine cream cheese and sugar. Mix on medium speed until mixture is smooth, scraping down sides as necessary.
3. With mixer running, add eggs one at a time.
4. Add cream, flour, vanilla, and salt. Mix on medium speed until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.
