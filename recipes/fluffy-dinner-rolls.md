# Fluffy Dinner Rolls

Makes 12 rolls

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup water
- 3 tablespoons bread flour
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 310 grams bread flour (or 95 grams whole-wheat flour and 215 grams bread)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 1/2 tablespoon, melted

## Instructions

1. Make a flour paste by whisking water and flour together in a small bowl. Microwave, stirring every 10-20 seconds, until the mixture thickens to a stiff, smooth, pudding-like consistency, 40-80 seconds.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk flour paste and milk. Whisk in egg. Add flour and yeast. Using a dough hook, mix until well incorporated, 1-2 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes (autolyse).
3. Add sugar and salt, then mix for 5 minutes. With mixer running, add softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix 5 more minutes, scraping down as necessary.
4. Transfer dough to lightly floured surface. Shape into a ball and transfer back to the now oiled bowl, seam side down. Cover and let rise 1 hour.
5. Oil 9" round cake pan. Transfer dough to counter, pressing gently to expel air (no flour should be necessary). Pat and stretch into an 8x9" rectangle, short side facing you. Cut lengthwise into 4 strips, then across each strip into 3 pieces. One piece at a time, pat and stretch into 2x8" strips, then roll from the short side to make a tight cylinder. Arrange rolls seam side down in the cake pan, 10 around the edge pointing inward and 2 in the center. Cover and proof until doubled in size, 45-60 minutes.
6. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat to 375Â°F. Bake rolls until golden brown, 25-30 minutes. Let rolls cool in pan for a few minutes, then invert them onto a wire rack. Flip them back over and paint the tops and sides with melted butter. Let them cool a while longer before serving.
