# Seared duck breast

## Ingredients

- skin-on duck breast
- salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F on the roast setting.
2. Pat duck breast dry with a paper towel. Score the skin side in a criss cross pattern. Salt both sides generously.
3. Heat a pan on medium heat. Add some oil to get a nonstick surface and lay the duck breast in skin-side down.
4. Turn heat down to medium low and sear, occasionally spooning the fat out as it accumulates, until the skin is golden brown and most of the fat has rendered.
5. Flip the breast over, scoop out the remaining fat, and place the pan in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temp of 131°F.

Let rest before slicing thin.
