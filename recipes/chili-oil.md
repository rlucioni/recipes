# Chili Oil

## Ingredients

- 12-16 dried red chili peppers
- 1 tablespoon red Sichuan peppercorns
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 star anise
- 1 tablespoon raw sesame seeds (optional)

## Instructions

1. Grind chilies and peppercorns in a spice grinder until the consistency of red pepper flakes.
2. Heat oil in a small pot. It's hot enough if you dip a chopstick in and see 🎶tiny bubbles🎶. Should _not_ be smoking hot! You'll burn the spices.
3. Kill heat. Quickly add peppers, peppercorns, star anise, and sesame seeds (if using), then stir well. Should sizzle vigorously.
4. Let cool, then jar. 

Can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.
