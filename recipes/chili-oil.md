# Chili Oil

## Ingredients

- 12-16 dried red chili peppers
- 1-3 tablespoons green and/or red Sichuan peppercorns
- 1 star anise
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Grind chilies and peppercorns in a spice grinder until the consistency of red pepper flakes.
2. In a small pot, heat 1/2 cup oil. It's hot enough if you dip a chopstick in and see ðŸŽ¶tiny bubblesðŸŽ¶. Should _not_ be smoking hot! You'll burn the spices.
3. Kill heat, add peppers, peppercorns, and star anise, and stir. Should sizzle vigorously.
4. Allow to cool, then jar. 

Can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.
