# Rustic Bread

Adapted from The Fresh Loaf's [Rustic Bread](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/recipes/rusticbread). Makes one large loaf.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound bread flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- Generous 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
- 11+ ounces filtered water

## Instructions

1. Make the dough the night before you want to eat bread! In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients until just combined, adding more flour or water as necessary to create a sticky, well-hydrated dough.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, poke small holes so that it can breathe, and leave it in a warm place overnight.
3. The next morning, stretch and fold the dough in the bowl every 30 minutes for 2-3 hours. (Pull edge of the dough up from the bottom and pull across to the other side, rotate the bowl and repeat.)
4. Place a well-floured towel in a basket, and drop in the dough. Fold the towel over and let rise for 2 hours.
5. Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F. Place a pan of water on the bottom rack and a cast iron skillet (or baking stone, if you have one) on the top rack.
6. When the oven is ready, flip the dough into the cast iron skillet, score a square in the top (a razor blade works well), place in the oven, and spritz liberally with water.
7. Bake for 35 minutes. 20 minutes in, rotate the pan and spritz the loaf again.

Allow the loaf to cool completely before slicing.
