# Ratatouille Confit Byaldi

Adapted from the [New York Times' Confit Byaldi](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/131rrex.html). Fills one 10" pan.

## Ingredients

### Piperade

Enough for 2 10" pans

- 1/2 yellow bell pepper
- 1/2 orange bell pepper
- 1/2 red bell pepper
- 1/2 yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, grated
- 4 whole canned tomatoes
- 1 sprig thyme
- 1 bay leaf

### Vegetables

Enough for 1 10" pan

- 1 zucchini
- 1 yellow squash
- 1 Japanese eggplant
- 4 Roma tomatoes

### Vinaigrette

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon reserved piperade

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
2. When oven is heated, roast peppers skin side up for 15 minutes, or until skin loosens. Broil briefly to char. Transfer to a bowl and cover to steam the peppers.
3. Cook the onion and garlic in a 10" oven-proof skillet over low heat until very soft but not browned.
4. Add canned tomatoes, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook on low until all the liquid has evaporated.
5. While the piperade is cooking, blanch the Roma tomatoes to make the skins easy to peel: boil the tomatoes for 1 minute before removing to an ice bath, then peel.
6. Peel the peppers and chop. Add to the onion and tomato mixture and cook a few minutes.
7. Blend mixture well and add about half (reserving at least a tablespoon) back into the bottom of the 10" skillet. Spread evenly.
8. Use a serrated knife to slice the tomatoes as thinly as possible. Do the same for the eggplant.
9. Use a mandoline to slice the zucchini and squash.
10. Heat oven to 275°F. While the oven is warming up, shingle the vegetables into the 10" pan on top of the piperade. There may be vegetables left over.
11. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over salt, pepper, and thyme leaves.
12. Cover ratatouille with a circle of parchment paper and bake for 90 minutes, until vegetables are tender.
13. Remove parchment paper and bake an additional 30 minutes, uncovered.
14. Let cool to room temperature before serving. Alternatively, chill and serve the next day.
15. Before serving, mix together olive oil, vinegar, and a tablespoon of the piperade. Drizzle on top of the ratatouille.

To reheat, put the pan in a 275°F oven until warm.
