# Clam Chowder

## Ingredients

- 6 pounds (about 48) clams (e.g., littleneck, cherrystone, topneck), washed and scrubbed
- 4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and diced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1/4 teaspoon dried)
- 1 cup cream

## Instructions

1. Rinse clams thoroughly. Purge clams by soaking in a salt solution of 30 grams of salt per liter of water. Leave at room temperature for 2-4 hours before rinsing again.
2. Bring clams and 3 cups water to boil in a large, covered pot. Steam until clams just open, 3-5 minutes.
3. Remove clams from shells, discarding any that didn't open. Mince clam meat and reserve. Strain clam broth through a sieve lined with a paper towel and reserve. Rinse and dry pot.
4. Fry bacon in pot until foamy. Reserve on a paper towel lined plate, leaving bacon fat in the pot. Add onion and cook until softened.
5. Add flour, stirring until lightly colored, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in reserved clam juice. Add potatoes, bay leaf, and thyme. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of the potato chunks.
6. Add bacon, clams, and cream. Bring to a simmer, then kill heat and taste for seasoning.

Serve with crusty bread. Best if reheated and served the next day.
