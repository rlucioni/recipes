# Clam Chowder

## Ingredients

- 7 pounds clams (e.g., littleneck, cherrystone, topneck), washed and scrubbed
- 4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and diced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme (or 1/4 teaspoon dried)
- 1 cup cream
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced (optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring clams and 3 cups water to boil in a large, covered pot. Steam until clams just open, 3-5 minutes.
2. Remove clams from shells, discarding any that didn't open. Mince clam meat and reserve. Strain clam broth through a sieve lined with a paper towel and reserve. Rinse and dry pot.
3. Fry bacon in pot until foamy. Add onion and cook until softened.
4. Add flour, stirring until lightly colored, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in reserved clam juice. Add potatoes, bay leaf, and thyme. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
5. Add clams, cream, and parsley (if using). Bring to a simmer, then kill heat and taste for seasoning.
