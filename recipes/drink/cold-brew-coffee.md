# Cold Brew Coffee

1:5 coffee to water ratio.

- 100 grams coarsely ground coffee
- 500 grams cold water

1. Pour water over grounds. Stir, cover, and allow to steep at room temperature for 12 hours.
2. Filter grounds from coffee (easiest if a French press is used) and refrigerate.

To serve, combine with ice, whole milk, amaretto, a dash of simple syrup, and a pinch of salt.
