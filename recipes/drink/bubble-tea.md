# Bubble Tea

Makes 1 serving.

### Ingredients

- 2 bags black tea
- 1/4 cup dried tapioca pearls
- agave nectar 
- whole milk
- sweetened condensed milk

### Instructions

1. Steep tea in 1 cup of boiling water for 4 minutes (or according to package instructions). Chill.
2. Cook tapioca pearls according to package instructions. If using Wufuyuan, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan and add tapioca pearls. Wait until they float, then cover and cook for 2 minutes on medium heat. Turn off the heat and keep the saucepan covered for another 2 1/2 minutes.
3. Move cooked tapioca pearls to a bowl of cold water for 20 seconds, then move to a dry bowl. Cover with agave nectar. Let sit for at least 15 minutes.
4. When ready to assemble, shake tea with condensed milk and ice in a cocktail shaker. Serve in a tall glass and add the pearls (nectar and all).

Serve with a giant straw, if available.
