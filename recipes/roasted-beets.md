# Roasted Beets

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch beets (about 2 pounds), trimmed and washed (save the greens!)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Put beets on a baking sheet. Rub with olive oil and salt. Roast until they can be easily pierced with a knife, 45-60 minutes.

Cool, slice off tops, and remove skins (spoon works well). Roasted beets don't bleed as much when cut.
