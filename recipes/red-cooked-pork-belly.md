# Red Cooked Pork Belly

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds skin-on pork belly, cut into 1-inch chunks such that every piece has some skin
- 1 nub ginger, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 heaven-facing chilies
- 3 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 pound king oyster mushrooms, 1-inch chunks
- 2 star anise
- 1/2 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 red cardamom pod
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 cup Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
- 1 1/2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons black vinegar

## Instructions

1. Add pork belly to a Dutch oven, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil 2 minutes to remove the scum. Strain, reserve meat, and clean the pot.
2. Heat some oil in the pot on medium heat. Add ginger, garlic, chilies, white parts of the scallions, mushrooms, and spices. Cook until fragrant.
3. Add back pork and sugar. Stir cooking constantly until pork is coated in sugar and the sugar is starting to melt.
4. Add Shaoxing wine and cook for 30 seconds. Add soy sauces, vinegar, and enough water to barely cover the pork pieces.
5. Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. Stir halfway through.
6. Remove lid and cook until the sauce is reduced to your desired consistency. Add green parts of scallions and serve.

Serve with rice.
