## Ingredients

- 5 pound whole roasting chicken, patted dry

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Line a sheet pan with foil and place a rack on the pan.
3. Pat chicken dry with a paper towel. Salt and pepper chicken cavity. Oil skin and sprinkle generously with salt. It works well to do this step directly on the rack on the sheet pan.
