# Duck Two Ways

Serves 4

## Ingredients

- 1 duck (5-6 pounds)
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed (optional)
- 3 sprigs rosemary (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F on convection.
2. Use a sharp knife to carve off breasts and leg quarters. Trim excess fat. Save carcass for duck stock. Make shallow diagonal cuts in skin of breasts and legs without cutting through to meat. Reserve breasts.
3. Salt legs on both sides. Lay them skin side up in a roasting dish, optionally on a bed of garlic and rosemary.
4. Roast legs until slightly brown and internal temperature reaches 165°F, about 30-45 minutes.
5. 15 minutes before legs are done, heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Salt breasts on both sides. Lay them skin side down and sear until brown and crispy, 5-7 minutes.
7. Flip and sear other side until breasts reach internal temperature of 135°F.

Let things rest 5 minutes before carving and serving. You can make a quick pan sauce with wine and butter. Deglaze with wine, cook down, season with salt and pepper, kill heat and swirl in butter.
