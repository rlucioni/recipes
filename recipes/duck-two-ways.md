# Duck Two Ways

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 1 duck (around 6 pounds)
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 3 sprigs rosemary

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F on convection.
2. Use a sharp knife to carve off the breasts and leg quarters. Save the carcass for duck stock.
3. Make shallow diagonal cuts in the skin of the breasts and legs without cutting through to the meat. Trim excess fat. Reserve breasts.
4. Lay legs, skin side up, on a bed of garlic and rosemary in a small roasting dish. Sprinkle with salt.
5. Roast legs for 1 hour, or until slightly brown and internal temperature reaches 165°F.
6. Fifteen minutes before the legs are done, heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
7. Salt breasts on both sides. Lay breasts skin side down and sear 5-7 minutes, or until browned.
8. Flip and sear other side until breasts reach internal temperature of 135°F.
9. Allow breasts and legs to rest 5 minutes before carving and serving.

You can make a quick pan sauce with wine and butter. Deglaze with wine, cook down, season with salt and pepper, kill heat and swirl in butter.
