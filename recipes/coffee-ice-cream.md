# Coffee Ice Cream

Yields 1 1/2 quarts.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups milk
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 200 grams sugar
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 150 grams coffee beans
- 6 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon espresso powder (optional)

## Instructions

1. Add milk, 1 cup cream, sugar, salt, and coffee beans to a small pot. Heat until it just starts to simmer. Turn off the heat, cover, and steep for 45 minutes.
2. Separate egg yolks into a large bowl. Heat the milk mixture until steamy. Whisking constantly, ladle some hot milk mixture into the egg yolks to temper the eggs, before pouring the egg mixture into the pot.
3. Add the cocoa powder and espresso powder. Heat on medium, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 170°F. The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. If not, keep cooking until thickened, adjusting the heat to keep the mixture below 170°F.
4. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer back into the bowl that used to have egg yolks. Stir in the remaining 1 cup cream.
5. Let cool to room temperature and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
6. Churn in an ice cream maker until thick, about 20 minutes.
7. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours until firm.
