# Sheet-pan Brats

## Ingredients

- 1 pound small (golf ball size) red potatoes, halved
- 2 red onions, halved and sliced 1/4" thick
- 3-4 brats
- whole-grain mustard
- red or white wine vinegar
- salt and pepper
- olive oil
- 3-4 rolls (not too big)
- sauerkraut
- salad greens
- radishes

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (roast). If you want, put your rimmed baking sheet in now to preheat it.
2. Toss potatoes with olive oil and salt. Separately, toss onions with olive oil only; salt will draw out too much water.
3. Place brats on one side of pan. Place potatoes cut-side down on the other side. Scatter onions around brats.
4. Roast until brats register 160°F and potatoes are tender, about 25-30 minutes. Flip brats halfway through.
5. While roasting, make a dressing with mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper, and olive oil.
6. When finished roasting, toss potatoes in the dressing. Briefly toast rolls in the oven until crisp, about 5 minutes.
7. Assemble brats: roll, brat, mustard, sauerkraut, onions. Toss greens and radishes in dressing with the potatoes.
