# Beef Rouladen

## Ingredients

- 2 skirt steaks, about 1 pound each (or other long-cooking cut like round, rump, chuck, bavette, or flap)
- Hot German mustard (e.g., Landsberg), to taste
- 8 strips bacon
- paprika, to taste
- 1/4 onion, thinly sliced
- 2 dill pickles, cut into thin spears
- cotton twine
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 4 cups low-sodium beef or chicken stock, cold!

## Instructions

1. Cut each skirt steak in half. Butterfly both halves such that when the meat is rolled up, it can be sliced against the grain. Tenderize both halves.
2. Apply a thin layer of mustard to the inside of the meat. Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Lay bacon strips on the meat perpendicular to the direction of the meat fibers. Season with paprika.
4. Lay onion slices and pickle spears on the meat parallel to the direction of the meat fibers.
5. Roll from the larger end of the meat to the smaller end. Tie with twine. Season the outside of the meat with salt.
6. Brown meat well in vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a pressure cooker, about 3 minutes per side. Reserve meat and reduce heat to medium-low.
7. Melt butter, then add flour. Cook roux for about a minute, then whisk in *cold* stock. Hot roux, cold liquid, no lumps.
8. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Transfer rouladen back to the pot along with any accumulated juices. The meat doesn't need to be completely covered!
9. Place lid on pressure cooker, bring to high pressure, and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
10. Allow pot to return to normal pressure naturally and remove lid. Reserve rouladen to a bowl and let rest for about 5 minutes. In the meantime, reduce gravy to desired consistency. Taste for seasoning.
11. Remove twine and cut rouladen into slices, perpendicular to the grain.

Serve with [braised red cabbage](braised-red-cabbage.md) and [spaetzle](spaetzle.md). Don't forget to spoon over the gravy!
