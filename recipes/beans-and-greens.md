# Beans and Greens

## Ingredients

- 1 onion, diced
- mushrooms
- 2 bunches chard, stems separated and everything chopped
- garlic or green garlic
- fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 cups (roughly) water or chicken stock
- 2 pounds white beans (e.g., navy)
- 1/4 cup parmesan

## Instructions

1. Saute onion, mushrooms, chopped chard stems, and green garlic (if using) until softened.
2. Add pepper, rosemary, bay leaf, and garlic (if using). Add chicken stock, then wilt in the chard leaves. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
3. Add beans and cook for another 2-3 minutes. This part takes much longer if using dried beans soaked overnight (e.g., 60-90 minutes). To accommodate them, simmer the beans in liquid with aromatics first, then add them to the sauteed onion, mushrooms, and wilted chard.
4. Stir in parmesan.

Finish with a drizzle of nice olive oil.
