Adapted from Hot Thai Kitchen's [Pad Thai recipe](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/best-pad-thai/). Serves 2.

## Ingredients

### Sauce

- 4 tablespoons water
- 4 tablespoons palm sugar, finely chopped (or substitute brown sugar)
- 4 tablespoons [tamarind paste](./tamarind-paste.md)
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce

### Everything else

- 1/3 pound dried rice noodles (size medium), soaked in room temperature water for 1 hour
- 8 oz protein (e.g., shrimp or chicken)
- 2 tablespoons dried shrimp, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/3 cup shallots (about 2 shallots worth), chopped
- 4 ounces pressed tofu, cubed
- 4 tablespoons pickled radish (or substitute Japanese takuan), finely chopped
- 3 eggs
- 6 ounces bean sprouts
- 3 ounces garlic chives (about 11 stalks), cut into 1.5-inch lengths
- 1/3 cup roasted unsalted peanuts, coarsely chopped
- Lime wedges, for serving

## Instructions
1.  Mix all sauce ingredients. Reserve.
2.  Heat oil in a large skillet. Sear protein until just cooked through. Reserve.
3.  Add a bit more oil. Stir fry dried shrimp, garlic, shallots, tofu, and pickled radish until shallots are translucent.
4.  Add noodles and sauce and stir fry until the noodles have absorbed all the sauce. Add more water as needed if the noodles are too dry and not cooked through yet.
5.  Push everything to the sides. Add more oil to the middle of the skillet and add eggs. Break up to scramble and push noodles on top of eggs. Let cook untouched for about 10 seconds before tossing.
6.  Add bean sprouts, chives, reserved protein, and half of the chopped peanuts. Toss until vegetables are evenly distributed and slightly wilted.

Serve topped with the rest of the peanuts with lime wedges on the side.
