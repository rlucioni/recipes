# Fengwei Eggplant

## Ingredients

### Eggplant

- 2-3 eggplants, rolling cut
- 4-5 tablespoons cornstarch

### Sauce

- 5 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar

### Slurry

- 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1/2 tablespoon water

### Stir fry

- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 dried chiles, deseeded and chopped
- 1/2 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- small bunch cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle some water on the eggplant pieces, then toss with cornstarch until eggplant is dry to the touch and there's an even layer of cornstarch on all surfaces.
2. Heat oil to 350Â°F. Fry coated eggplant until deep golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel lined plate.
3. Mix sauce, mix slurry, and reserve both. Heat some oil in a skillet over medium heat. Briefly sizzle garlic, then do the same with the chiles. Add wine and stir briefly. Add sauce and bring to a boil, about 90 seconds. Add slurry and cook briefly, until thickened. Kill the heat.
4. Toss in eggplant and cilantro, mix briefly, then serve. You can also serve the sauce on the side and dip the eggplant in it.
