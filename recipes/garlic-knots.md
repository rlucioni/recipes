# Garlic Knots

Makes 8.

## Ingredients

- 6-7 garlic cloves, minced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 118 grams water, warmed
- 3/4 teaspoon active-dry yeast or 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 180 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 6 ounces low-moisture mozzarella
- [marinara sauce](pizza-sauce.md) for dipping

## Instructions

1. Heat garlic, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon water over low heat. Cook 5-10 minutes until fragrant and barely toasted. Remove from heat and strain. Add garlic solids to a large bowl and reserve the garlic butter.
2. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Mix in 2 teaspoons garlic butter.
3. Add flour and salt to the bowl with the garlic solids. Stir in yeast mixture until combined. Knead until dough is supple and slightly sticky, about 10 minutes. The dough should pull away completely from the sides of the bowl by the end. If the dough does not start to pull away from the sides after 5 minutes, add a bit more flour.
4. Form dough into a ball, cover lightly with garlic butter, and let rise, covered, for 45 minutes in a warm oven.
5. Cut half of the mozzarella into 8 equal chunks. Grate the rest. Grease the bottom of a 10" cast iron skillet with half of the remaining garlic butter.
6. Roll out dough into a 6"x8" rectangle on a lightly floured board and cut into 8 1"-strips. Roll strips diagonally to make twisted dough ropes. Tie each rope into a knot around a chunk of mozzarella and place in the oiled skillet.
7. Cover and proof in a warm oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and preheat to 500°F. Paint knots with half of the remaining garlic butter and bake for 6 minutes.
8. Paint with rest of garlic butter and top with grated cheese. Bake until tops are golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Serve with marinara sauce on the side.
