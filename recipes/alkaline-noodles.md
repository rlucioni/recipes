# Alkaline Noodles

Adapted from [Chinese Cooking Demystified's Sichuan-style alkaline noodles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ercib1/recipe_how_to_make_sichuan_burning_noodles_plus/). Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 300 grams bread flour
- 125 grams water
- 1/2 teaspoon [sodium carbonate](sodium-carbonate.md)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the serving broth or sauce such that it's ready by the time the noodles are boiled.
2. Dissolve sodium carbonate in water. Slowly mix into noodles by hand until incorporated.
3. Knead by hand for 8 minutes. The dough is too dry and crumbly to mix by machine.
4. Shape dough into a rectangle. Wrap in plastic and let rest on the counter for 30 minutes.
5. Start a large pot of water boiling. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Work with one piece at a time while keeping the others covered.
6. Flatten a dough piece by hand and pass through the widest setting of a pasta roller. This dough is too tough and rubbery to roll out by hand!
7. Fold the dough in half and pass through again. Repeat 2 more times.
8. Keep passing the dough sheet through the machine, decreasing the width setting each time until desired thickness.
9. Flour both sides of the sheet and pass through the cutting attachment or fold and hand-cut into noodles.
10. Generously flour the noodles and reserve.
11. Repeat steps 6-10 for the remaining dough pieces.
12. Boil the noodles for 60-90 seconds, depending on the thickness. Strain and serve immediately.
