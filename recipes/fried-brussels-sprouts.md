# Brussels Sprouts

## Ingredients

- brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- vegetable or peanut oil
- [gastrique](apple-gastrique.md)

## Instructions

1. Heat oil to 375Â°F.
2. Slowly lower in a few brussels sprout halves at a time. Watch for boilovers! You really don't want to do too many at once.
3. Once they're all in, fry until deep brown with a little green still visible, 2-3 minutes.
4. Fish out with a spider and drain on a rack set over a sheet pan.

Move to a big bowl, toss with gastrique, and serve immediately.
