# Chemex

Adapted from [Chemex 101](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/brewing-product-care-instructions) and [Blue Bottle Coffee](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex?type=whole-bean). Yields 2 cups.

## Ingredients

- 40 grams coffee, ground to a coarseness resembling sea salt (20 on an Encore burr grinder)
- 600 grams water plus more for warming carafe and mugs (~1 L), heated to 200°F (94°C)
- warmed cups

## Instructions

1. Open a Chemex filter into a cone shape so that one side has three layers. Place it in the carafe so that the three-layer portion covers the spout without obstructing it.
2. Saturate the filter and warm the carafe with hot water. Discard the water through the spout, leaving the filter in place.
3. Pour ground coffee into the filter and shake to settle.
4. There are four total pours. In all, they should take roughly 4 minutes to complete. Avoid pouring directly on the filter.
   1. 1 minute: wet the grounds by pouring 40 grams of water in a circular pattern, starting at the center and spiraling outwards. Let the coffee bloom for 45-55 seconds.
   2. 1 minute: pour an additional 160 grams of water, starting at the center and spiraling outwards before spiraling back to the center. Let the water drain until the slurry drops 1 inch from the bottom of the filter.
   3. 1 minute: repeat step #2, pouring 200 grams water.
   4. 1 minute: repeat step #2, pouring 200 grams water.
5. Let the water finish dripping through the grounds.

## Scaling up

Single-cup ratio is 20 grams coffee to 300 grams water. Rule of thumb is to multiply single-cup ratio by desired number of cups and grind coarser. Goal is 6 minute brew time. For 3 cups:

- 60 grams coffee, ground at 25
- 900 grams water

Pours:
- 60 grams to bloom
- 240 grams to hit 300 grams
- 300 grams to hit 600 grams
- 300 grams to hit 900 grams
