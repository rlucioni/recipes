# Chemex

Yields 2 cups

## Ingredients

- 30 grams coffee, ground to a coarseness resembling sea salt (25 on an Encore burr grinder)
- 500 grams boiling water, plus extra for rinsing filter and warming cups

## Instructions

1. Open a Chemex filter into a cone shape so that one side has three layers. Place it in the carafe so that the three-layer portion covers the spout without obstructing it.
2. Saturate the filter and warm the carafe with hot water. Discard the water through the spout, leaving the filter in place.
3. Pour ground coffee into the filter and shake to settle.
4. Add about 60g water and bloom for 45 seconds, swirling to agitate grounds for even saturation.
5. Add remaining water in an aggressive manner, pouring in a circular motion and avoiding the edges. Maintain level bed about 1/2 inch from the top of the brewer. Stir around the edges with a spoon.
6. Let the water finish dripping through the grounds, then remove the filter.

## Scaling up

Single-cup ratio is 15 grams coffee to 250 grams water. Rule of thumb is to multiply single-cup ratio by desired number of cups and grind coarser. Goal is 4-5 minute brew time. For 3 cups:

- 45 grams coffee, ground at 28
- 750 grams water
