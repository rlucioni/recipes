# Miso Soup

Serves 2. The soup does not reheat well, so it's better to make a large batch of dashi and assemble the soup right before eating.

## Ingredients

- 1 batch [dashi](dashi.md) (or 4 cups water + 1 tablespoon dashi powder, and less miso later - salty)
- 1 generous tablespoon dried wakame, soaked in water for 10 minutes and drained
- 1/3 pound soft or silken tofu, cut into small cubes
- mushrooms, such as shimeji mushrooms or sliced shiitake mushrooms
- leafy greens such as spinach, roughly chopped
- 2 scallions, chopped
- salmon fillet, optional
- 4 tablespoons miso

## Instructions

1. Saute the white parts of the scallions along with mushrooms in a saucepan.
2. Add dashi and bring to simmer. If using salmon, add it now and poach until it's near 100Â°F. Reserve.
3. Add wakame, tofu, leafy greens, and green parts of the scallions. Wait for the broth to come back to a simmer after adding each ingredient before adding the next one.
4. With broth at a simmer, add the miso. To help distribute the miso, put the miso in a ladle, submerge the ladle, and stir the miso into the small volume of broth in the ladle before mixing with the rest of the soup.
5. Turn off the heat and serve. Take care not to boil the soup once the miso is added.
