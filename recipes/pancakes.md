# Pancakes

Makes 16 4" pancakes

## Ingredients

- 280 grams all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. 
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and vegetable oil. Whisk in milk and vanilla.
3. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's fine if the batter is a little lumpy with a few streaks of flour left. Let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 200Â°F for keeping pancakes warm. A wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet works well.
5. Heat a carbon steel pan. Once hot, add a little oil then wipe it out. Make a small test pancake first. Flip when edges start to set and tiny bubbles start to break on the surface. Keep pancakes warm in the oven as you finish them.
