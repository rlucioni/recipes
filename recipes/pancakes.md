# Pancakes

Adapted from [Allrecipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/162760/fluffy-pancakes/). Makes 4 large pancakes.

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 170 grams flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Mix milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside.
2. Whisk together dry ingredients in a large bowl.
3. Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla into the milk mixture. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
4. Let batter rest for about 10 minutes.
5. Preheat a nonstick pan on medium-high heat. To test if the pan is hot enough, add a few drops of water to the pan. The water should dance across the surface. If the droplets evaporate immediately, the pan is too hot. Turn heat down to medium-low.
6. Ladle 1/4 of the batter into the center of the pan. Flip when bubbles begin to set around the edges. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Serve with warm syrup and butter.
