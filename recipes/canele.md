# Canele

Yields 14-16 2" caneles (Matfer molds)

Note: season new tin-lined copper molds before first use. Preheat oven to 400°F. Apply a thin coat of vegetable shortening to each mold. Invert on a wire rack over a pan. Bake for 20-45 minutes. Wipe away any excess and let cool completely. Repeat 2-3 times. Seasoned tin should have a dark brown or black color.

## Ingredients

### Custard

- 50 grams butter
- 485 grams whole milk
- 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
- 100 grams all-purpose flour
- 200 grams sugar
- pinch of salt
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 50 grams rum

### Mold coating

- 1 part beeswax, cut into small cubes (e.g., 50 grams)
- 2 parts ghee (e.g., 100 grams)

## Instructions

### Day 0

1. Combine butter, milk, and vanilla beans and pod in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from heat and let steep 10 minutes.
2. In a bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt.
3. In another bowl, whisk together eggs and yolks. Whisk in hot milk mixture, a little at a time at first to temper the eggs. Whisk in rum. Reserve vanilla bean pod.
4. Pour liquid into dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Pass batter through fine-meshed sieve. Add vanilla bean pod back to mixture. Refrigerate for at least 48 hours.

### Day 2

1. Preheat oven to 375°F on convection. Put batter on the counter so it can come to room temperature.
2. Combine beeswax and ghee in a glass jar or other heatproof container. Place in a simmering pot of water until totally melted, stirring occasionally.
3. To coat the molds, working 2 at a time: warm for 30 seconds in the oven, fill to the top with melted mixture, quickly dump back into the original container, then invert on rack to drip and set. Freeze the molds for 15 minutes.
4. Remove vanilla bean from batter and whisk before use. Fill molds to within 0.5-1 cm from the top. Don't overfill or you'll get white butts; this seems to happen when the batter souffles out of the mold while baking.
5. Bake filled molds, directly on foil-lined pan, for 1 hour. The bottoms should be mahogany brown, the color of dark maple syrup. Tip out each canele onto a wire rack and let cool completely. Leave molds inverted so they can drain.

Best within hours of baking. Wipe out the molds, don't wash them.
