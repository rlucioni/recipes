## Ingredients

### Custard

- 50 grams butter
- 485 grams whole milk
- 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
- 100 grams all-purpose flour
- 200 grams sugar
- pinch of salt
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 50 grams rum

### Mold coating

- 40 grams beeswax, cut into small cubes
- 100 grams ghee

## Instructions

### Day 0

1. Combine butter, milk, and vanilla beans and pod in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from heat and let steep 10 minutes.
2. In a bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt.
3. In another bowl, whisk together eggs and yolks. Whisk in hot milk mixture, a little at a time at first to temper the eggs. Whisk in rum. Reserve vanilla bean pod.
4. Pour liquid into dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Pass batter through fine-meshed sieve. Add vanilla bean pod back to mixture. Refrigerate for at least 48 hours.

### Day 2

1. Preheat oven to 500째F.
2. Combine beeswax and ghee in a glass jar or other heatproof container. Place in a simmering pot of water until totally melted, stirring occasionally.
3. Very briefly warm molds in preheating oven.
4. To coat each mold: set on a wire rack, fill to the top with melted mixture, quickly dump back into the original container, then invert on rack to drip. Put coated molds in freezer for 15 minutes.
5. Whisk batter before use. Fill molds to 1 cm from the top, about 60 grams batter per mold. Don't overfill or you'll get white butts!
6. Bake filled molds at 500째F for 10 minutes. Lower temp to 375째F and bake until dark mahogany brown, an extra 45-55 minutes. Tip out each canele onto a wire rack and let cool completely. Leave molds inverted so they can drain.

Best within hours of baking. Don't wash molds! Just wipe them out while warm.
