## Instructions

### Day -2

1. Combine butter, milk, and vanilla beans and pod in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from heat and let steep 10 minutes.
2. In a bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt.
3. In another bowl, whisk together eggs and yolks. Whisk in hot milk mixture, a little at a time at first to temper the eggs. Whisk in rum. Reserve vanilla bean pod.
4. Pour liquid into dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Pass batter through fine-meshed sieve. Add vanilla bean pod back to mixture. Refrigerate for at least 48 hours.

### Day 0

1. Preheat oven to 500째F.
2. Combine beeswax and ghee in a glass jar or other heatproof container. Place in a simmering pot of water until totally melted, stirring occasionally.
3. To coat each mold: fill to the top with melted mixture, quickly dump back into the original container, then invert on a wire rack to drip out. Chill coated molds for 15 minutes.
4. Fill molds to 1 cm from the top (60 grams batter each in a Matfer 2" mold?). Don't overfill!
5. Bake filled molds at 500째F for 10 minutes. Lower temp to 375째F and bake until dark mahogany brown, an extra 45-50 minutes. Tip out each canele onto a wire rack and let cool completely.

Don't wash molds! Just wipe them out.
