# Crunchwrap Supreme

Makes 4.

## Ingredients

- 5 large flour tortillas
- 8 ounces sharp cheddar, grated
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 1 medium-sized tomato, diced
- tortilla chips
- leftover cooked chicken or other meat, cubed
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1 lime
- salt and chipotle chili powder, to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix the sour cream, zest of 1 lime, juice from half the lime, chipotle chili powder, and salt in a small bowl. Reserve.
2. Tear one of the tortillas into quarters. Divide the fillings into four equal portions.
3. For each remaining whole tortilla, sprinkle with water and microwave 10 seconds. Then layer cheese, green onions, tomatoes, sour cream mixture, chicken, tortilla chips, and more cheese in the center, leaving the outer inch of tortilla uncovered.
4. Place one of the tortilla quarters over the fillings. Fold the edges of the whole tortilla over the piece of tortilla to form a sealed packet.
5. Place seam-side down in a nonstick skillet with some oil and toast for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until golden brown and crispy.
6. Repeat with the remaining 3 tortillas.
