# Almond Blueberry Upside-Down Cake

For a 9" cake pan

## Ingredients

### Blueberry Layer

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 100 grams sugar
- 200 grams blueberries (if frozen, toss with 1 tablespoon flour?)

### Batter

- 150 grams blanched, slivered, or sliced almonds, toasted
- 110 grams all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
- 4 eggs
- 225 grams sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest (2 lemons)
- 3/4 teaspoon almond extract
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil

### Topping

- 1/3 cup sliced almonds, toasted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300°F.
2. Melt butter in 9" cake pan; you can use the preheating oven. Sprinkle an even layer of sugar on top, followed by an even layer of blueberries.
3. In a food processor, pulse together almonds, flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda until almonds are finely ground. Reserve.
4. In the now-empty food processor, process together eggs, sugar, lemon zest, and almond extract until pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Add in melted butter and vegetable oil with the processor running.
5. Add almond mixture back to the food processor and pulse to combine with wet ingredients.
6. Carefully pour batter over the blueberry layer in the pan, smoothing it evenly.
7. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55-65 minutes. Internal temp should be around 200-210°F.
8. Let cake cool for about 15 minutes. Run a paring knife around the sides to loosen, then invert onto a wire rack. Top with toasted sliced almonds.
