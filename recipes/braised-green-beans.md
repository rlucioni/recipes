# Braised Green Beans

## Ingredients

- 1 shallot, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, sliced
- 3 sprigs thyme
- 1 pound tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 teaspoon tomato paste
- 3/4 pound green beans, cut into 1-2 inch pieces (Romano beans work the best)
- salt, pepper, and sherry, to taste

## Instructions

1. Saute shallot, garlic, and thyme in a generous amount of olive oil until softened.
2. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, and sherry. Cook 1-2 minutes until tomatoes have released a lot of liquid.
3. Add beans and bring the liquid to a simmer. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes. Adjust cooking time depending on the beans. They should be tender but not falling apart.
4. Remove the lid and simmer until liquid has reduced to desired thickness.
