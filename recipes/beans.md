# Beans

## Ingredients

- beans
- salt
- kombu
- bay leaf

## Instructions

1. Most beans need to be soaked for 4-12 hours in salted water.
2. Drain and rinse soaked beans. Add to a pressure cooker and cover with at least 3 cups of water for each dry cup of beans.
3. Salt generously. Add a strip of kombu, a bay leaf, and a drizzle of oil.
4. Cook on high pressure. Cooking time depends on the bean (8 minutes for garbanzo, black, pinto, and kidney beans. 5 minutes for cannellini, navy, great northern, and christmas lima beans).

Drain and discard kombu and bay leaf before using in other recipes.
