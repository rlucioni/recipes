# Lard

## Ingredients

- pork fat
- water

## Instructions

1. Remove as much of the meat as possible from the pork fat. Cut fat into 1-inch cubes.
2. Add fat to a pot with a generous splash of water. Cook on medium heat, stirring constantly, until all the water has evaporated.
3. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook and stir until a decent amount of fat has rendered out. Try not to let any pieces start to brown.
4. Continue to cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, until all the fat has rendered, about 30-45 minutes.
5. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and store in an airtight container in the fridge.
