# Porridge

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups rice, rinsed
- 10 cups water
- onion, diced
- soy sauce
- sake
- shrimp, chopped
- green onion, sliced
- Chinese spinach, chopped
- napa cabbage, chopped
- eggs, chopped
- dried scallop, optional
- bonito flakes, optional
- white pepper, optional

## Instructions

1. Bring rice and water to a boil in a large pot. Simmer, half-covered, until rice grains have burst and are very soft, about 30-60 minutes. It should look like oatmeal when done. Stir every few minutes to keep it from sticking. If it gets too thick, add more water to thin it out.
2. While the rice is cooking, saute onion in a pan. Add lamb, soy sauce, and sake. Reserve once the lamb is just done cooking.
3. In the same pan, saute shrimp and green onion with some sake. Reserve with the lamb.
4. Once the rice is ready, throw everything else in! Spinach, napa, eggs, reserved lamb and shrimp (plus any accumulated juices), and/or any other vegetables you want. Add more water to thin as necessary.

Porridge will thicken as it cools. It can be thinned with more water.
