# Porridge

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups rice, rinsed
- 10 cups water
- dried scallop, optional
- onion, diced
- mushrooms, chopped
- soy sauce
- shrimp, chopped
- sake
- yuchoy or similar, chopped
- napa cabbage, chopped
- 4-5 eggs, scrambled and chopped
- green onion, sliced
- bonito flakes, optional
- white pepper, optional

## Instructions

1. Bring rice, water, and dried scallop to a boil in a large pot. Simmer, half-covered, until rice grains have burst and are very soft, about 30-60 minutes. It should look like oatmeal when done. Stir every few minutes to keep it from sticking. If it gets too thick, add more water to thin it out.
2. While the rice is cooking, saute onion and mushrooms with soy sauce. Reserve.
3. Saute shrimp with sake. Reserve.
4. Saute yuchoy and napa. Reserve.
5. Once the rice is ready, throw everything in, including green onion. Add more water to thin as necessary.

Porridge will thicken as it cools. It can be thinned with more water. Top with bonito flakes and white pepper.
