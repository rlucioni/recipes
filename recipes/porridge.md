# Porridge

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups rice, rinsed
- 10 cups water
- dried scallop, optional
- onion, diced
- soy sauce
- sake
- shrimp, chopped
- green onion, sliced
- Chinese spinach, chopped
- napa cabbage, chopped
- eggs, chopped
- bonito flakes, optional
- white pepper, optional

## Instructions

1. Bring rice, water, and dried scallop to a boil in a large pot. Simmer, half-covered, until rice grains have burst and are very soft, about 30-60 minutes. It should look like oatmeal when done. Stir every few minutes to keep it from sticking. If it gets too thick, add more water to thin it out.
2. While the rice is cooking, saute onion in a pan.
3. In the same pan, saute shrimp and green onion with some sake. Reserve with the lamb.
4. Once the rice is ready, throw everything else in! Spinach, napa, eggs, reserved shrimp (plus any accumulated juices), and/or any other vegetables you want. Add more water to thin as necessary.

Porridge will thicken as it cools. It can be thinned with more water.
