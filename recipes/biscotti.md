# Biscotti

Yields about 30

## Ingredients

- 180 grams whole almonds, lightly toasted
- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs, plus 1 egg beaten with a little water (egg wash)
- 200 grams sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F.
2. Coarsely chop about 1 cup of almonds (4/5ths total) in food processor. Make sure no whole almonds remain; they'll catch on the knife later when cutting. Transfer to bowl and reserve.
3. Process remaining almonds until finely ground. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Process to combine. Transfer to bowl with chopped almonds, mix, and reserve.
4. Process 2 eggs until lightened in color and doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. With processor running, slowly add sugar. Add melted butter, almond extract, and vanilla. Process to combine. Gently fold together wet and dry ingredients.
5. Divide batter in half. With floured hands, shape the halves into 8x3" rectangles. Brush tops with egg wash. Bake until loaves are golden and just beginning to crack on top, 25-30 minutes. Let loaves cool on baking sheet for 30 minutes.
6. Transfer loaves to cutting board. Using serrated knife, slice each loaf on slight bias into 1/2" thick slices. Lay slices cut side down on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 35 minutes, flipping slices halfway through.

Let cool completely before serving.
