# Tamarind Paste

Adapted from Hot Thai Kitchen's [Tamarind Paste](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/making-tamarind-paste/)

## Ingredients

- 1/2 brick tamarind pulp (about 7-8 ounces)
- 2 cups boiling water

## Instructions

1. Break up tamarind pulp into small pieces with hands. Add boiling water and let sit for 20 minutes.
2. Use hands to massage the pulp until most of it is separated from the fibers. The pulp should be the consistency of apple sauce.
3. Pass the mixture through a mesh strainer (ideally not a super fine-mesh strainer) into a small saucepan.
4. Heat on stove until simmering. Transfer to 1.5 cup mason jar and screw on the lid.

Store in the fridge.
