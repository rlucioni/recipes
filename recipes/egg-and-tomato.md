# Egg and Tomato

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 1 pound tomatoes, cut into wedges
- 1/8 teaspoon MSG
- dash of soy sauce
- salt, white pepper, and sugar, to taste
- sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs with salt and white pepper (about 1/4 teaspoon of each).
2. Scramble until almost cooked, taking care not to break up the curds too much. Reserve.
3. Saute tomatoes and scallions in the pan used to cook the eggs with MSG, soy sauce, salt, and sugar until softened but not falling apart. Add some water to achieve a saucy consistency.
4. Add eggs and mix thoroughly. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
5. Turn off the heat and briefly mix in a bit of sesame oil before serving.

Serve with white rice.
