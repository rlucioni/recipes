# Blackberry Pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches of [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 1250 grams blackberries (8 cups)
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 lemon
- 6-7 tablespoons tapioca
- Cream and sugar for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375&deg;F.
2. Mix tapioca and sugar together. Shake over berries and mix together. Let sit for 15 minutes to draw out juice.
3. Add juice of 1 lemon. Mix, then add to crust. Cover with top crust and cut air holes.
4. Place on foil-lined sheet pan and bake until crust is browned and filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes. You might need to cover the crust to keep it from getting burned.
