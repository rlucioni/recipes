# Blackberry Pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches of [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 1250 grams blackberries (8 cups)
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 lemon, juice and zest
- 6-7 tablespoons tapioca (shake box!)
- Cream and sugar for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. Mix tapioca and sugar together. Shake over berries and mix together. Let sit for 15 minutes to draw out juice.
3. Add lemon juice and zest. Mix, then add to crust. Cover with top crust and cut air holes.
4. Place on foil-lined sheet pan and bake until crust is browned and filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes. You might need to cover the crust to keep it from getting burned.

Chill thoroughly in the fridge before slicing. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
