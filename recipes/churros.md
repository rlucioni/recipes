# Churros

Inspired by Chocolateria San Gines in Madrid

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 160 grams all-purpose flour
- 2-3 eggs, beaten
- vegetable oil
- open star piping tip (Wilton 1M)

### Ganache

- 2 ounces dark chocolate, broken up
- 2 tablespoons cream
- pinch of salt
- pinch of instant espresso powder (optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat oil to 360Â°F.
2. Bring water, butter, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add flour and stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Slowly stir in beaten eggs.
3. Spoon mixture into a piping bag with star tip. Squeeze 4-inch strips (or a long spiral) of dough into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
4. Microwave cream until steamy. Watch for boilover! Add chocolate, salt, and espresso powder to the hot cream. Stir until the chocolate melts.
