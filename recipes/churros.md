# Churros

Inspired by Chocolateria San Gines in Madrid

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 160 grams all-purpose flour
- 3 eggs, beaten
- vegetable oil
- open star piping tip (Wilton 1M)

### Chocolate

- 2-3 ounces dark chocolate, broken up
- pinch of salt
- pinch of instant espresso powder (optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat oil to 360Â°F.
2. Bring water, butter, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add flour and stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Slowly stir in beaten eggs.
3. Spoon mixture into a piping bag with star tip. Squeeze a long spiral of dough into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
4. Microwave chocolate, salt, and espresso powder for ~10 seconds at a time, stirring in between until the chocolate melts.

Serve in a parchment funnel.
