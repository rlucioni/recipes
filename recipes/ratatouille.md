# Ratatouille

## Ingredients

- 2 eggplants, chopped
- 3 squash (e.g., zucchini, yellow squash), chopped
- 2 onions, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
- 2 pounds fresh tomatoes, chopped
- thyme
- bay leaf

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F on convection roast.
2. Toss eggplant and squash with olive oil and salt. Roast until soft and/or golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.
3. In a large pot, saute onion with some olive oil and salt until softened.
4. Add garlic, sizzle briefly, then add peppers, tomatoes, thyme, and bay leaf. Simmer long enough to heat everything through and reduce to your liking. It's a stew, so it shouldn't be too watery or completely dry.
5. Mix in roasted eggplant and squash. Season to taste.

Good with [hard-boiled eggs](hard-boiled-eggs.md) on top.
