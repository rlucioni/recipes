# Ratatouille

## Ingredients

- 2 eggplants, chopped
- 3 squash (e.g., zucchini, yellow squash), chopped
- 2 onions, chopped
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 6 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
- 2 pounds fresh tomatoes, chopped
- thyme
- bay leaf
- splash of vodka

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F on convection roast.
2. Toss eggplant and squash with olive oil and salt. Roast until soft and/or golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.
3. In a large pot, saute onion with some olive oil and salt until softened.
4. Add tomato paste and cook until starting to brown. Add garlic and sizzle briefly. Then add peppers, tomatoes, thyme, bay leaf, and vodka. Simmer long enough to heat everything through and reduce to your liking. It's a stew, so it shouldn't be too watery or completely dry.
5. Mix in roasted eggplant and squash. Season to taste.

Good with [hard-boiled eggs](hard-boiled-eggs.md) on top.
