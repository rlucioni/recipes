# Quinoa, Eggs, and Steak

Serves 2

## Ingredients

- 1 pound sirloin tip or flap steak
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2-3 eggs
- 1-2 bananas

## Instructions

1. Cook quinoa. Add quinoa and 2 cups of water to a rice cooker. Salt to taste and fluff with a fork.
2. While the quinoa cooks, salt steak and sear in a cast iron skillet over medium heat until medium-rare. Reserve.
3. Fry eggs and use them to top the quinoa. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Optionally, prepare bananas. Cut them in half crosswise, then lengthwise. Heat some oil over medium-high heat and fry bananas. Be sure to watch the heat and turn it down if the bananas are browning too quickly. You want enough heat to caramelize and brown the slices.
