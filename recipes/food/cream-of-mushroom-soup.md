# Cream of Mushroom Soup

Adapted from [Chef John's cream of mushroom soup](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2009/12/cream-of-mushroom-soup-pure-liquid-moon.html). Serves 4.

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 2 pounds white or brown button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 rounded tablespoon flour
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and whole
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup heavy cream
- salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste

1. Combine butter, mushrooms, and a big pinch of salt in a pot over medium-high heat. Your goal is to caramelize the mushrooms; this is where all the flavor comes from!
2. When the mushrooms are golden brown, add onions.
3. Once onions are translucent, add flour. Cook flour for a few minutes to take off the raw edge.
4. Add thyme, garlic, chicken stock, and water. Simmer for an hour.
5. Puree. Stir in cream. Use chicken stock to thin it out if necessary, not cream! (It'll be too rich otherwise.) Season to taste.
