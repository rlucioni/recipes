# Clam Chowder

Adapted from [NYT's Clam Chowder](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016717-the-best-clam-chowder). Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 20 littleneck clams (avoid large ones, they're tough)
- 3 strips thick cut bacon, diced
- 2 leeks, cleaned and coarsely chopped
- 1 onion, coarsely chopped
- 2 Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (Sauvignon blanc works well)
- 3 springs thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Place clams in a pot and add about 4 cups cold water. Set over medium-high heat and cook partially covered until clams have opened. Discard any which fail to open. Will boil over if covered completely!
2. Strain clam broth through a sieve lined with a paper towel and reserve. Remove clams from shells, chop, and reserve.
3. Rinse pot and return to stove over medium-low heat. Add bacon and cook until it starts to brown. Remove and reserve bacon, leaving fat in the pot.
4. Add leek and onion, cooking until soft but not brown. Add thyme and bay leaf. Stir in potatoes and wine, and cook until wine has evaporated. Add enough clam broth to cover potatoes and simmer gently with pot partly covered until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
5. When potatoes are tender, stir in cream, clams, and bacon. Add salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Allow to come to a simmer, then remove from heat.
6. Allow chowder to cool (i.e., set), at least 30 minutes (overnight is better). Reheat until steam just starts to come off the surface, then serve.

Serve with bread toasted with olive oil, and garnish with a crack of pepper.
