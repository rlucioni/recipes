# Hollandaise Sauce

Adapted from [Chef John's hollandaise sauce](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2007/03/hollandaise-101-can-sauce-really-sense.html). Serves 2 (about 1/4 cup).

- 1 egg yolk
- juice of 1/4 lemon
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

1. Add egg yolk and lemon juice to a bowl. Beat, suspending bowl directly over low heat. Stop when whisps of steam appear and the mixture appears to have reached the ribbon stage.
2. Dribble in warm, melted butter while beating mixture. Add slowly to avoid breaking emulsion.
3. Season with a pinch of salt and a dusting of cayenne.

Serve immediately! Thickens quickly if left to cool. If this happens, use a few drops of hot water to loosen.
