# Turnip Puree

## Ingredients

- 1 russet potato
- 1 large or two medium turnips (roughly 3 times as much turnip as potato)
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Peel and cube the turnip and potato. Boil for 15 minutes, or until tender.
3. Drain very well before returning veggies to the pot on medium heat. Boil away excess moisture.
4. Add butter and puree with an immersion blender. Taste for salt before serving.
