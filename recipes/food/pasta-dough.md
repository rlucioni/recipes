# Pasta Dough

### Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons water
- 140 grams all-purpose flour
- 140 grams semolina flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Instructions

1. Beat eggs, olive oil, and water together.
2. If using a food processor, mix dry ingredients in a food processor. Drizzle in egg mixture until the dough forms a grainy mixture. If not, mix dry ingredients on a large cutting board. Make a well and add egg mixture. Whisk with a fork, slowly incorporating flour until mixture is too thick to work with a fork.
3. Knead dough for 5 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with plastic and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.

Shape into desired pasta shape.
