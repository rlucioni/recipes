# Oxtail Ragu

Adapted from [A Drunken Duck's oxtail ragu](http://www.adrunkenduck.com/braised-oxtail-ragu/). Serves 6.

### Ingredients

- 3 pounds oxtail
- flour for dredging
- salt
- 1 large onion, roughly chopped
- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped
- 3 stalks celery, roughly chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 small bunch thyme
- red wine

### Instructions

1. Salt oxtail pieces and coat in flour. Brown in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat.
2. Add vegetables, bay leaves, and thyme. Pour in enough red wine to submerge oxtail pieces halfway.
3. Bring wine to a boil and apply the pressure cooker lid. Cook on high pressure for 90 minutes.
4. Reserve oxtail pieces. Remove bay leaves and thyme. Blend the vegetables and liquid remaining in the pot. Reduce until the sauce coats the back of a spoon and running your finger across it leaves a clear line.
5. Pull meat off the oxtail bones once they're cool. Add the shredded meat back to the reduced sauce. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve with [fresh pasta](pasta-dough.md), like pappardelle.
