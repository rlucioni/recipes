# Torrone (Turrón)

Adapted from [Chef John's torrone](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2016/02/torrone-italian-nut-nougat-confection.html). Yields ~36 bite-sized pieces.

- 200 grams honey
- 125 grams white sugar
- 1 egg white
- pinch salt
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 generous tablespoons lemon zest
- 1 1/2 cups roasted (Marcona, blanched) almonds
- 1/2 cup roasted pistachios

1. Line a 9x5 baking dish with parchment paper. Rub with half a lemon, seeded.
2. Roast nuts in a 350&deg;F oven for 5-8 minutes until fragrant. Toss halfway through, and keep warm in oven when done.
3. In a pot, combine honey and sugar over low heat. Stir continuously for 30 minutes until the mixture goes from golden and grainy to pale and smooth.
4. Add a pinch of salt to egg white and whip until soft peaks form (shaving cream stage).
5. Whip egg white into mixture, one whiskful at a time until combined.
6. Continue stirring on low heat for an additional 40 minutes, or until ribbons remain on the surface for 4-5 seconds. To test for doneness, drizzle some of the mixture into cold water. The nougat should feel like hard clay.
7. Stir in vanilla and lemon zest, followed by warm nuts.
8. Quickly press the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Flatten using the same half lemon from before. Cover with another sheet of parchment and press flat with a glass.
9. Allow to rest 2-3 hours before cutting into small pieces.
