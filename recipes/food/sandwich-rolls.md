# Sandwich Rolls

Adapted from [Chef John's sandwich rolls](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2016/01/sandwich-rolls-because-size-and-shape.html). Makes three rolls.

- 1 1/8 teaspoons dry active yeast (1/2 package)
- 3/4 cup warm water
- 9 1/2 ounces bread flour, by weight
- 3/4 teaspoon salt

1. Combine yeast and water in a large mixing bowl. Make sure the yeast is alive before proceeding!
2. Add flour and salt. Knead, adding flour as necessary, until a smooth, soft, slightly sticky dough forms.
3. Form dough into a smooth ball. Place dough in bowl, lightly oiling both. Cover and let rise for 90 minutes, or until doubled in size.
4. Press dough down into a uniform shape. Divide into three equal portions. Use a cupped hand and a circular motion to roll pieces into uniformly smooth balls. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.
5. Press balls into long ovals, about six inches long, then roll up tightly, positioning seam on bottom. Taper tips slightly. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
6. Cover rolls and let rise 60 minutes, or until doubled in size. Score down the length of each roll with a sharp knife. Use a spritz bottle to mist rolls.
7. Bake rolls at 450&deg;F for 20 minutes. Place a pan of water in the bottom of the oven to help develop the crust. Halfway through, rotate and mist again.
8. Transfer rolls to a rack and allow them to cool completely before cutting.
