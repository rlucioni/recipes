# Garlic Soup

Adapted from [Chef John's garlic soup](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/04/celebrating-national-garlic-day-with.html). Serves 2.

- About 6 cups of cubed French or Italian bread
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more to drizzle on bread cubes
- 6-10 garlic cloves, grated
- 2 ounces ham, diced
- 1-2 teaspoon paprika or to taste
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
- Salt, pepper, cayenne to taste
- 4 large eggs

1. Toast bread cubes coated in olive oil at 350&deg;F until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add ham and warm through.
3. Add paprika and toast for a few seconds, then toss in garlic and stir briefly. Don't let it brown! Add bread and toss to coat in paprika-and-garlic-infused oil.
4. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, then reduce to medium. Add parsley and season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
5. To prepare the eggs, serve most of the soup, leaving about an inch in the bottom of the pot. Add the eggs and cook to desired consistency. Remove to bowls.
