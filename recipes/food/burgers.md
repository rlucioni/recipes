# Burgers

Yields 4 burgers

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds beef chuck (fatty, flavorful, tough cut), trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- 4 buns (potato works well), toasted
- toppings (cheese, caramelized onions, tomato, carmelized pineapple, etc.)

## Instructions

1. Freeze meat and butter in a single layer until meat is firm, about 35 minutes.
2. Grind in food processor with salt and pepper until finely ground into pieces about the size of rice grains.
3. Gently pack into 4 patties about 3/4 inch thick. Make a depression in the center of each patty to keep them flat when they cook. Optionally, freeze patties for an additional 30 minutes.
4. Sear in a hot cast iron pan, 4-7 minutes per side without moving, until 125&deg;F in the center for medium-rare.
5. Let patties rest on buns for 5 minutes with some cheese on top, so it melts.

Serve with fries or potato chips and a pickle.
