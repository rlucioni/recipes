# Panzanella

Adapted from [Chef John's Panzanella](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2014/08/under-my-panzanella-ella-ella-ella.html). Serves 2.

- day-old bread, cut into cubes
- grated Parmesan cheese
- cherry tomatoes, halved
- minced garlic
- basil chiffonade
- olive oil
- red wine vinegar
- salt, pepper, and sugar to taste

1. Mix tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper, and sugar in a large bowl. Add equal parts olive oil and vinegar so the mixture becomes "swampy."
2. Coat bread cubes liberally with olive oil and toast in a skillet until golden-brown and crunchy.
3. Remove from heat, spread bread cubes in a single layer, and sprinkle parmesan on evenly. Stir gently and let cool 5 minutes.
4. Add bread cubes to the tomato mixture and toss thoroughly. Let sit a few minutes to allow the bread to soak up the dressing.
5. Add a little more olive oil and vinegar if the bread completely soaks up the dressing.
6. Mix in basil chiffonade and serve.
