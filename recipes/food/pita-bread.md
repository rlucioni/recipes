# Pita Bread

Adapted from [Chef John's pita bread](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/04/pita-bread-whats-in-your-pocket.html). Makes 8 pita breads.

### Ingredients

- 2 1/4 teaspoons dry active yeast
- 1 cup warm water (about 100&deg;F)
- 13 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt

### Instructions

1. Form sponge by combining yeast, water, and 4 1/2 ounces (1 cup) flour. Let sit for 15 minutes; proceed only if small bubbles are present.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Slowly stir in remaining flour (about 2 cups) with a dough hook until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Knead for 5-6 minutes after reaching correct consistency.
3. Lightly oil dough's surface, then let rise about 2 hours or until doubled in size.
4. Remove to a floured surface. Press down with hands, then cut into 8 pieces. Form small, round loaves and let rise 30 minutes, covered.
5. Place a cast iron or nonstick skillet, lightly painted with olive oil, over medium-high heat. Roll out loaves into 1/4 inch thick rounds. Let rest 5 minutes. Grill loaves until they puff and turn golden brown, about 3 minutes total.
