# Roast Beef

Adapted from [Chef John's roast tenderloin of beef](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2011/12/roast-tenderloin-of-beef-with-porcini.html).

- 3 pound beef tenderloin roast
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut in half
- 1/2 cup Cremini mushrooms, soaked and diced
- 1/2 cup sliced shallots
- 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1/4 cup cream
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragon

1. Preheat oven to 325&deg;F.
2. Clean meat of any excess silver skin and tie with twine. Salt generously.
3. Set a skillet with some vegetable oil over high heat. Sear the meat on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Reserve.
4. Turn the heat to medium and throw in a tablespoon of butter and the mushrooms. Cook until browned, then add the shallots. Cook until soft, then add the vinegar, chicken stock, and cream. Stir.
5. Put the meat back in the pan, turn in the sauce to coat, then move to the oven. Cook until internal temperature reaches 125&deg;F, about an hour.
6. Reserve meat to a plate, tent loosely with foil, and let rest.
7. Boil sauce until desired thickness is reached. Adjust seasoning as necessary, then add remaining tablespoon of (cold) butter and tarragon.

Goes well with [spaetzle](spaetzle.md) and broccoli.
