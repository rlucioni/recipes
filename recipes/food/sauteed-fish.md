# Sauteed fish

Serves 2.

### Ingredients

- 4 slices ginger
- 1 Thai bird chili, roughly chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 2 filets fish, skin on (salmon, branzini, and red snapper work well)
- 2 scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sake

### Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ginger and chilis. Sizzle for 30 seconds. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds before adding filets, skin side down, and scallions.
2. Flip filets when cooked 2/3 of the way through (1–3 minutes, depending on filet thickness). Add soy sauce and sake. Cook another 30-60 seconds, or until barely cooked through.

Serve with rice.
