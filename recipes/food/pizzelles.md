# Pizzelles

Makes about 16 cookies.

## Ingredients

- 215 grams flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- pinch of salt
- 2 eggs
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Heat a nonstick pizzelle iron. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs. Slowly incorporate sugar, mixing until combined. Whisk in vanilla and lemon extracts. Gradually whisk in melted butter until batter is smooth.
3. Use a spatula to slowly incorporate dry ingredients until just combined.
4. Pipe or scoop roughly 2 tablespoons of batter in a circle in the center of each pattern on the pizzelle iron. Close the iron, seal with the clasp, and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to remove the pizzelles, mold into shapes if desired (e.g., upside-down bowl), and move to a wire rack to cool.
