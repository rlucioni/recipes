Makes 12.

### Ingredients

Dough:
- 3/4 cup water, warm
- pinch of sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 300 grams flour

Filling:
- 1 pound finely chopped meat (pork, shrimp, lamb, etc)
- various fillings (daikon radish, chives, napa cabbage)
- soy sauce, garlic powder, sesame oil, rice wine, ginger, and salt to taste

### Instructions

1. Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand 10 minutes and add oil.
2. Stir yeast mixture into flour in a large bowl and knead for 5-10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary until a supple dough forms. Let rise 1 hour, punching down halfway through.
3. Mix together filling ingredients by hand in a circular motion until the ground meat forms a paste consistency. Microwave a small portion to taste and adjust the seasoning. Let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
4. Split dough into 4 equal pieces. Work with one piece at a time and keep the others covered.
5. Cut each piece into 3 pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll out each ball into a 5 inch circle with a wooden dowel, making sure to roll the edges thinner than the center. Fill with about 3 tablespoons of filling and start pleating the edges of the dough in a counterclockwise direction until sealed.
6. Allow to proof for 30 minutes.
7. Place in a bamboo steamer on individual pieces of parchment paper, cover the steamer, and place the steamer over boiling water (preferably in a wok). When the water starts to boil, steam for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, but keep the lid on for 5 minutes.

If desired, serve with a soy sauce and black vinegar dipping sauce.
