# Roasted Chicken with Gravy

Adapted from Julia Child's roasted chicken recipe, from [Cooking with Master Chefs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679748296).

- 5 pound whole roasting chicken
- Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
- 1 lemon, halved
- 4 sprigs thyme
- 2 sprigs rosemary
- 6 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 onion, coarsely chopped
- Olive oil as needed
- Chicken stock or broth as needed (about 1/2 cup)
- Flour as needed (about 1 generous tablespoon)

0. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.
1. Add the lemon juice, juiced lemon halves, thyme, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper to a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine.
2. Toss chicken (rinsed) in the prepared marinade. Salt and pepper the cavity, then stuff with the marinade.
3. Make a bed of onion in a cast-iron skillet and rest the chicken on top, tucking in the nubbins. Pour juices from the bowl over the chicken. Drizzle with a generous amount of olive oil and sprinkle with a generous amount of salt.
4. Place in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 170&deg;F.
5. Move chicken to a plate, place pan over low heat, and add enough chicken stock and flour to form a gravy.

Serve with rice or potatoes, peas or green beans.
