# Grilled Cheese

### Ingredients

- bread, sliced less than 1/2-inch thick
- mayonnaise
- cheddar cheese, grated
- apple, thinly sliced

### Instructions

1. Heat a pan over medium heat.
2. Spread a _thin_ layer of mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread. Put the bread in the pan, mayonnaise-side down. It should sizzle a little. Put cheese on top of the slices and cover with a lid to help the cheese melt.
3. When the cheese is halfway melted, nestle apple slices into the cheese on one slice and flip the other slice over on top of it. Press with a spatula. Turn the sandwich, pressing often, until crusty and cheese is melted.
