# Chemex

Adapted from [Chemex 101](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/brewing-product-care-instructions) and [Blue Bottle Coffee](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex?type=whole-bean).

## Ingredients

- 50 grams coffee, ground to a coarseness resembling sea salt (20 on an Encore burr grinder)
- 700 grams water plus more for warming carafe and mugs (~1.5 L), heated to 200&deg;F (94&deg;C)
- warmed cups

## Instructions

1. Open a Chemex filter into a cone shape so that one side has three layers. Place it in the carafe so that the three-layer portion covers the spout without obstructing it.
2. Saturate the filter and warm the carafe with hot water. Discard the water through the spout.
3. Pour ground coffee into the filter and give it a gentle shake to settle.
4. There are four total pours. In all, they should take roughly 4 minutes to complete. Avoid pouring directly on the filter.
   1. 1 minute: wet the grounds by pouring 100 grams of water in a circular pattern, starting at the center and spiraling outwards. Let the coffee bloom for 45-55 seconds.
   2. 1 minute: pour an additional 200 grams of water, starting at the center and spiraling outwards before spiraling back to the center. Let the water drain until the slurry drops 1 inch from the bottom of the filter.
   3. 1 minute: repeat step #2.
   4. 1 minute: repeat step #2.
5. Let the water finish dripping through the grounds.
