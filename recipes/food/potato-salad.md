# Potato Salad

Serves 6.

- 2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2-3 strips thick-cut bacon
- 3 eggs, hard boiled and sliced
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup dill pickle, chopped
- Mayonnaise

1. Add potatoes and garlic to a pot of generously salted water. Simmer until potatoes are tender, 25-30 minutes. Slice and reserve.
2. Fry bacon in a pan. Reserve bacon and a teaspoon of bacon fat.
3. Combine potatoes, bacon, eggs, onion, and pickles in a bowl along with enough mayonnaise for the mixture to just hold together. Add bacon fat, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne to taste.
4. Refrigerate for at least an hour.
