# Pan Pizza

Dough: makes two 10" pizzas
- 400 grams bread flour
- 10 grams (about 2 teaspoons) kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling
- 4 grams (about 1/2 teaspoon) instant yeast
- 275 grams water
- 8 grams extra-virgin olive oil

Toppings:
- pizza sauce
- grated full-fat, dry mozzarella cheese
- toppings as desired (peppers, onions, sausage, basil, etc)

1. Combine dough ingredients in a large bowl. Mix until dough ball comes together and no dry flour is left. Let rise overnight.
2. Split dough into two equal pieces. They can be used now or frozen for later use.
3. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a 10" cast iron skillet. Place a dough ball in the center and use your hands to push it down into a disc. Cover and let rise for 2 hours.
4. Preheat oven to 500&deg;F, or as high as the oven will go.
5. Push dough to fill all corners of the pan and deflate any large bubbles. Lift dough edges to release any bubbles underneath.
6. Top with sauce, cheese, and any toppings. Bake for 15 minutes.
7. Optional: continue to cook on the stove until the bottom reaches the desired level of crispiness.

Top with fresh basil and red pepper flakes.
