Adapted from [Japanese Cooking 101's Sponge Cake](http://www.japanesecooking101.com/sponge-cake-recipe/).

## Ingredients

- 20 grams butter
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 90 grams cake flour
- 3 eggs
- 90 grams sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- whipped cream and fruit, for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Heat 1 inch of water in a deep pot to create a double boiler.
2. Line a 9" cake pans with parchment paper on the bottom and sides.
3. Microwave butter and milk in a ramekin until just melted. Reserve.
4. Sift cake flour into a bowl. Reserve.
5. Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add sugar and beat until well-combined.
6. Beat the eggs with an electric mixer on high while placing the bowl on a double boiler. Beat until the egg mixture feels warm to the touch.
7. Remove the eggs from the pot and continue beating on high until the mixture is thick enough to form soft peaks. There should be no liquid egg left in the bottom of the bowl. Watch the video to determine the exact consistency.
8. Gently mix in the vanilla. Gradually add the flour while folding it in. Then fold in the butter and milk mixture.
9. Pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
10. Allow the cake to cool before removing from the pan.
11. Top with whipped cream and fruit. Alternatively, double the recipe to make 2 cakes and make a layered cake with whipped cream frosting.
