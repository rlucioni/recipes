# Roasted Kabocha Squash Soup

Adapted from [Simply Recipes' roasted kabocha squash soup](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/roasted_kabocha_squash_soup/). Serves 4.

- 1 kabocha squash, quartered and cleaned
- 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2-inch piece of fresh ginger root, grated
- 1 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F. Rub squash quarters with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast squash skin-side up for 45 minutes until cooked through, soft, and caramelized at the edges. Remove from oven and reserve.
2. In a pot, sweat onions and celery. Add garlic, ginger, cumin, and coriander, and cook for a few minutes to wake up spices.
3. Add kabocha squash flesh to pot. Add the stock, salt and pepper. Bring soup to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and purée. Optionally, stir in coconut milk. Season to taste.

Garnish with lime juice and cilantro.
