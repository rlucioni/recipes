# Udon

Serves 2.

- 4 cups water
- 4 inch by 5 inch piece of kombu, with slits cut
- 3 cups loosely packed bonito flakes
- 6 dry shitakke mushrooms, soaked about 10 minutes in warm water
- Soy sauce and mirin to taste
- Fresh ginger
- 600 grams of fresh udon noodles
- 2-3 bok choys, chopped
- 4 pieces thick-cut bacon, halved
- 4 soft-boiled eggs
- 2 green onions

1. Start by preparing the dashi stock. Put kombu and water in a pot over medium-low heat. Remove kombu just before the water begins to boil.
2. Add bonito flakes and simmer for 30 seconds. Let cool slightly, then strain back into pot through a mesh strainer lined with a paper towel.
3. Turn the heat to medium-high and add shitakke mushrooms, soy sauce, mirin, salt, and ginger.
4. In a separate pot, boil noodles for two minutes. When the broth reaches a simmer, add bok choy bottoms, then tops.
5. Combine noodles and broth in bowls. Top with bacon and eggs.

Garnish with green onion.
