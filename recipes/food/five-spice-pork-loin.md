2. Place pork in the marinade and turn several times until meat is well-coated.
3. Marinate meat 30 minutes, turning meat several times.
4. Sear meat in a lightly-oiled cast iron pan set over medium high heat. Cook about 3 minutes per side, until internal temperature reaches 125&deg;F. Optionally, brush with marinade while cooking.
