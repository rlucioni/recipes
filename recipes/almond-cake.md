# Almond Cake

For a 9" cake pan

## Ingredients

### Batter

- 150 grams blanched, slivered or sliced almonds
- 110 grams all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
- 4 eggs
- 225 grams sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest (2 lemons)
- 3/4 teaspoon almond extract
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil

### Topping

- 1/3 cup blanched, slivered or sliced almonds
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300°F.
2. Grease 9" cake pan and line with parchment. Mix sugar and lemon zest topping now so it has time to sit (oleo-saccharum).
3. In a food processor, pulse together almonds, flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda until almonds are finely ground. Reserve.
4. In the now-empty food processor, process together eggs, sugar, lemon zest, and almond extract until pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Add in melted butter and vegetable oil with processor running.
5. Add almond mixture back to food processor and pulse to combine with wet ingredients.
6. Transfer batter to pan. If you're using jam, mix it in a bowl to loosen; add half of batter to pan and freeze 10 minutes; spread over loosened jam and freeze another 10 minutes; then add remaining batter. Sprinkle over the extra toasted almonds. Top with the sugar and lemon zest mixed earlier.
7. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 55-65 minutes. Internal temp should be around 200-210°F.

To release the cake, first let it cool 15 minutes. Run a paring knife around the sides to loosen. Let it cool until easy to handle, then invert onto a wire rack. Peel off parchment, then reinvert onto a second wire rack.
