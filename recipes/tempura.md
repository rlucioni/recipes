## Instructions

1. Prep all the seafood and vegetables. Remove as much moisture from the surface of ingredients as possible using paper towels.
2. Heat oil in a dutch oven to 350°F. Prep the dipping sauce in the meantime.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together flour and baking soda. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together water and egg.
4. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir with chopsticks until it just starts to form a lumpy batter. Add more flour or water to adjust to the consistency of heavy cream.
5. In small batches, dust ingredients lightly in flour, coat with batter, and add to the hot oil.
6. Fry, maintaining an oil temperature between 320-350°F, until crispy, flipping ingredients constantly. Most ingredients are done in 1-2 minutes.
7. Scoop out fried bits of batter between batches to prevent burning.
