# Short Rib Ragu

Makes enough for about 3 pounds of pasta.

## Ingredients

### Ragu

- 4-5 pounds bone-in short ribs
- 2 onions, chopped
- 4 carrots, chopped
- 4 celery stalks, chopped
- 4 tablespoons tomato paste
- 8 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cups red wine
- 28 ounces crushed tomatoes
- 4 cups beef broth
- 3 bay leaves
- fresh thyme and/or rosemary (leaves stripped and chopped, optional)

### Everything else

- pasta (e.g., lumache, cavatelli)
- parmesan
- parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Pat short ribs dry with paper towels and season with salt.
2. Heat some vegetable oil in a pot. Brown short ribs on most sides, working in batches to avoid crowding if necessary. Reserve. Soak up excess fat with a paper towel.
3. In the same pot, saute onions, carrots, and celery until softened.
4. Add tomato paste and garlic. Sizzle briefly until fragrant.
5. Add wine, scrape up any browned bits, and bring to a simmer.
6. Stir in crushed tomatoes, beef broth, bay leaves, thyme and/or rosemary. Add reserved short ribs (and any accumulated juices), making sure they're mostly submerged. Simmer, partially covered, until short ribs are very tender and falling off the bone, about 3 hours. (Alternatively, braise, covered, in the oven at 325Â°F for the same amount of time, checking occasionally to add more liquid if it gets too thick.)
7. Carefully fish out the short ribs. While they're cooling, fish out any bones, bay leaves, and thyme and/or rosemary stems. Skim excess fat from the surface. Shred the short ribs with 2 forks then stir back into the pot. Taste for seasoning. Keep warm.
8. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Reserve 1-2 cups of pasta water before draining.
9. Toss pasta with a generous amount of ragu, adding pasta water as necessary to adjust consistency.

Serve topped with parmesan and parsley.
