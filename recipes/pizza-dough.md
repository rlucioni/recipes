# Pizza Dough

Makes 3 13" pizzas.

## Instructions

Follow the [white bread with poolish](white-bread-with-poolish.md) recipe until it's time to proof. At that point:

1. Working with plenty of bench flour, dump out dough, cut into thirds, and shape each piece into a tight ball.
2. Rest the dough balls on a floured board and cover with a towel. Proof about 1 hour on the counter, or 6-48 hours in the fridge.
