# Cornbread

Intended for a 6" cast-iron skillet.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup cornmeal
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 egg
- 4 tablespoons butter
- Optional additions: 1/2 cup blueberries or Hatch green chile

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Leave the cast-iron skillet inside the oven while you make the batter.
2. Whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a mixing bowl.
3. Separately, whisk the milk and egg together. Whisk the mixture into the dry ingredients.
4. Melt the butter and whisk it into the batter, reserving about 1/2 tablespoon.
5. Reduce oven to 375°F. Remove the skillet from the oven and pour in the reserved butter (it should sizzle) followed by the batter. The butter should pool around the edges of the batter. Bake until center registers 195-200°F, roughly 20 minutes.
