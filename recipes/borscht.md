# Borscht

## Ingredients

### Broth

- 2 pounds boneless pork butt/shoulder, trimmed and cut in half
- 1 onion, halved
- 1 carrot, cut into chunks
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 10 cups water

### The rest

- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 1/2 pounds beets, trimmed, peeled, and shredded
- 2 carrots, peeled and shredded
- 1 6-ounce can tomato paste
- 1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, cut into chunks
- 1 small head cabbage, shredded
- 1/3 cup fresh dill, chopped
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Throw all the broth ingredients into a pot and bring to a boil. Skim off the foam. Simmer covered for 2 hours.
2. Reserve the pork. Strain the broth into a large bowl. Skim fat if needed. Once pork is cool, cut into bite-sized pieces.
3. Saute onion, beets, and carrots with some oil and salt until softened.
4. Stir in tomato paste and cook until a fond forms, 1-2 minutes. Add the potatoes, cabbage, and reserved broth. Simmer covered until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
5. Stir in dill and vinegar. Season to taste.

Garnish with sour cream and chopped dill. Serve with bread. Better the next day.
