- [Flax oil](https://www.amazon.com/Barleans-Organic-Oils-Lignan-16-Ounce/dp/B002VLZ81M)
- Paper towels
- Tongs or chopsticks
- Good ventilation

### Instructions

1. Remove wok handles if possible. Preheat oven to 500&deg;F and put a pan or sheet of foil on the bottom rack. Squirt some flax oil into a small bowl or plate and set it aside with your paper towels. Ventilate area (e.g., open windows, set up fan).
2. Remove protective coating applied to the wok at the factory. It's often a clear lacquer and can be hard to see. It will make it difficult to fully season the pan. Fill the wok 2/3 full with water and boil for 10 minutes. Pour the water out and immediately scrub as hard as you can with hot, soapy water and steel wool. Take your time, scouring the pan vigorously inside and out. When finished, rinse, dry with a paper towel, and transfer the pan to a burner on high heat. If you scrubbed hard enough, the pan will start to rust at this point. Start the seasoning process below immediately!
3. Wad up a small piece of paper towel and use your tongs to dip it into the reserved flax oil. Using a circular motion, rub thin layers of oil into the bottom of the wok. Working one layer at a time, build up a resin-like polymer on the bottom of the pan. It should develop a dark, almost mahogany color. Give each layer a chance to smoke profusely and burn off before applying another. Use fresh paper towel wads as necessary.
4. Once the bottom of the pan is almost black, turn off the burner. While it's still hot, apply a thin layer of flax oil to the entire pan, inside and out, then put it upside down on the top rack of the oven. Leave it for 20 minutes. Repeat this step (thin layer of oil, 20 minutes in the oven) 3-4 times until the entire pan is a dark mahogany (almost black) color.
5. Let the pan cool. If you did it right, the pan should be very smooth and the bottom should almost feel like glass.

Try using your newly seasoned wok exclusively for frying things (e.g., [General Tso's chicken](../food/general-tsos-chicken.md)) for a while before using it to saut√©e or steam anything. This will give the seasoning a chance to develop into a strong, non-stick surface and make it less likely to flake off. If it does flake off, don't panic, but be a little sad because you'll need to strip off any seasoning that's left and start the entire seasoning process again. Use thinner layers of oil next time.

After cooking in the wok, clean it with hot water and a brush or sponge. Don't use soap if you can avoid it. Rinse, dry with a paper towel, and put the pan over high heat. Apply a thin layer of vegetable oil to the bottom of the wok with a paper towel and let it start smoking before turning off the heat.
