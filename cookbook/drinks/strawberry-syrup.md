# Strawberry Syrup

Adapted from [Chef John's strawberry syrup](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/06/cold-strawberry-soda-on-hot-summer-day.html).

### Ingredients

- 4 pounds ripe strawberries, hulled and quartered
- 3 1/2 cups cold water
- 2 cups sugar
- splash of rum

### Instructions

1. Add strawberries and water to a pot. Bring to a boil on high heat, then simmer for 15 minutes.
2. Strain into a separate pot using a strainer lined with a paper towel. Don't try to push the boiled strawberries through; you'll get a cloudy syrup.
3. Bring the strained liquid back to a boil and add the sugar. Simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Let cool, add rum, then transfer to a bottle or jar.

Keep refrigerated.
