# Bubble Tea

Makes 1 serving.

### Ingredients

- 2 bags black tea
- 1/4 cup dried tapioca pearls
- agave nectar
- sweetened condensed milk

### Instructions

1. Steep tea in 1 cup of boiling water for 4 minutes (or according to package instructions). Chill.
2. Cook tapioca pearls according to package instructions. If using Wufuyuan, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan and add tapioca pearls. Wait until they float, then cover and cook for 2 minutes on medium heat. Turn off the heat and keep the saucepan covered for another 2 1/2 minutes.
3. Drain tapioca pearls into a strainer and transfer them to a bowl of ice water for 20 seconds. Strain again and move back to the same (now empty) bowl. Cover with agave nectar. Let sit for at least 15 minutes.
4. When ready to assemble, shake tea with condensed milk and ice in a cocktail shaker. Serve in a tall glass and add the pearls (nectar and all).

Serve with a giant straw, if available.
