# Sliced Fish Szechuan Style

Inspired by the [Sliced Fish Szechuan Style](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mt9hbhxml8458m8/sliced-fish-szechuan-style.mp4) at Gourmet Dumpling House in Boston.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound swai fillets
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry)
- 1 egg white
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 scallions, coarsely chopped
- Nub of ginger, grated
- 3 cloves of garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili bean sauce
- 2 cups water
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
- Napa cabbage, coarsely chopped strips
- Mung bean sprouts
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 10 grams dried red chili peppers, chopped
- 10 grams (green) Szechuan peppercorns, ground

### Instructions

1. Cut the fish into 1/4-inch thick slices at a 45-degree angle.
2. Mix salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon rice wine. Add egg white, mix, then incorporate cornstarch. Add fish slices, toss, then cover with plastic wrap. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
3. Heat (chili) oil in a skillet or wok over high heat. Briefly sizzle scallions, ginger, garlic, and chili bean sauce.
4. Add water, cooking wine, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil and salt to taste.
5. Add cabbage and mung bean sprouts. Boil for 1 minute then reserve the vegetables to a serving bowl.
6. In a small pot, start heating roughly 1/2 cup of oil. It's hot enough if you dip a chopstick in and see ðŸŽ¶tiny bubblesðŸŽ¶ forming. In a separate pot, poach the marinated fish slices. (They shouldn't poach completely, since you'll be moving them to the hot broth.) Use a spider to transfer the poached fish directly into the broth, toss, then pour everything into the serving bowl.
7. Top with chopped dried chilis and ground Szechuan peppercorns. Pour hot oil over the surface. It should sizzle!

Serve immediately with rice.
