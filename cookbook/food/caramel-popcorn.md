# Caramel Popcorn

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup popcorn kernels
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3/4 cup butter
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 250&deg;F.
2. Pop popcorn in vegetable oil. Be sure not to salt it at this point. Set aside.
3. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt.
4. Bring caramel mixture to a boil, stirring continuously. Once boiling, boil without stirring for 4 minutes. 
5. Remove from heat and quickly stir in vanilla extract and baking soda.
6. Immediately drizzle hot caramel sauce over popcorn and stir until evenly coated. A silicone spatula works well for this part. Be careful not to crush the popcorn too much.
7. Spread caramel popcorn on a oiled, foil-lined baking sheet.
8. Bake for 1 hour, stirring popcorn every 15 minutes.
9. Allow to cool completely before breaking up popcorn into a bowl.
