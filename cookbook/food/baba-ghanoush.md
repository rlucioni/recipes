Adapted from [Minimalist Baker's baba ghanoush](http://minimalistbaker.com/simple-baba-ganoush/).

### Ingredients

- 1 large Italian eggplant (look for a round stem-indentation, which means fewer seeds)
- olive oil for roasting
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- juice from 1 lemon, to taste
- 3 tablespoons tahini, or to taste
- pinch of cayenne
- salt, cayenne, chopped Italian parsley to taste

### Instructions

1. Slice eggplant into 1/4 inch rounds and sprinkle with salt. Let sit to draw out moisture for 10 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels.
2. Lay eggplant slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and brush with olive oil. 
3. Broil for 5-10 minutes until brown and soft. Wrap in foil to steam for 5 minutes.
4. Peel off skin and put flesh in food processor. Add lemon juice, garlic, tahini, and cayenne. Process until creamy.
5. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Add any herbs and pulse to combine.

Keeps in the refrigerator for several days.
