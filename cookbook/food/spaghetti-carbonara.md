Adapted from America's Test Kitchen's Foolproof Spaghetti Carbonara. Serves 2.

### Ingredients

- 4 slices thick-cut bacon
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 garlic cloves, grated
- 3/4 ounce grated Pecorino Romano
- 1/2 ounce grated Parmigiano Reggiano
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper

### Instructions

1. Cut bacon into 1/2 inch pieces. Cook on medium-high heat in a skillet with 1/4 cup of water for 8 minutes.
2. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for an additional 8 minutes until the bacon is brown.
3. Bring 5 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.
4. After the bacon has browned, add the garlic and stir briefly. Immediately remove bacon and garlic to a paper towel to drain.

6. When the pasta finishes cooking, remove 1/2 cup of starchy pasta water and drain the rest of the pasta.
