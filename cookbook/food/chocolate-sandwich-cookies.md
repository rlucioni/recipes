# Chocolate Sandwich Cookies

### Ingredients

- ~24 small, matching sugar cookies
- 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate
- 1/2 cup jam
- pecans

### Instructions

1. Melt chocolate. Microwaving for small increments and stirring often works well.
2. Stir jam to loosen it.
3. Spread jam on the face of a sugar cookie. Press together with a matching cookie. Spread chocolate on the face of the sandwich.
4. Place a pecan in the center of sandwich face while the chocolate is still runny.

Allow chocolate to harden before eating. If two cookies aren't quite the same size, place the larger cookie on top. It looks better. Although you can use toasted pecans for this, the texture of untoasted ones works well.
