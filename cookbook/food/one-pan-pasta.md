# One Pan Pasta

Adapted from [Chef John's one pan pasta](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2014/08/one-pan-orecchiette-with-sausage-and.html). Serves 2.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 8 ounces spicy Italian sausage
- 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 generous cup pasta (orecchiette and elbow macaroni work well)
- 2 large handfuls spinach, roughly chopped

### Instructions

1. Saute onions in olive oil until just browned. Remove sausage from casing, break up, and add to onions. Cook until browned and a nice fond forms.
2. Dump in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and stir to deglaze. Once the broth reaches a simmer, dump in pasta. Cook the pasta, stirring, until broth is absorbed. Add remaning broth a cup at a time, allowing it to be absorbed in between. Crank heat to high when adding broth, then back down to medium when it reaches a boil.
3. Toss in spinach and stir until it wilts. Taste for seasoning.

When serving, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
