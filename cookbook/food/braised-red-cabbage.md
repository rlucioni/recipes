# Braised Red Cabbage

Adapted from [Chef John's braised red cabbage](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/04/braised-red-cabbage-that-is-all.html).

### Ingredients

- 1 red cabbage (about 3 pounds), cored and sliced thin
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2/3 cup water
- 1/2 cup red wine
- 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- Pinch of caraway seeds, ground
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Halve and core cabbage. Thinly slice both halves.
2. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a skillet. Add cabbage and season with salt.
3. Add water, red wine, red wine vinegar, sugar, and ground caraway seeds.
4. Keeping the cabbage moving, braise until cabbage is tender and liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Add more water as necessary.
5. Taste for seasoning. If it's not sweet enough, try adding some honey.

Optionally, start the recipe with bacon and onions. Depending on how much bacon is used, reduce the amount of other fat used.
