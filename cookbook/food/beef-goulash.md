# Beef Goulash

Adapted from [Chef John's beef goulash](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/01/beef-goulash-thick-hungarian-soup-thin.html). Serves 4.

### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes, seasoned generously with salt and pepper
- 2 onions, coarsely chopped
- 2 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons caraway seeds, toasted and ground
- 2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 4 cups chicken broth (1 to deglaze pan, 3 more added to stew)
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 3 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

### Instructions

1. Add vegetable oil to a skillet over high heat. Sear meat in hot pan until well-browned. Transfer to pot.
2. Saut√© onions in the same pan with olive oil and salt over medium heat, until edges are golden-brown. Transfer to pot.
3. In the same pan, toast caraway, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, marjoram, and thyme over medium heat. When you can just smell the caraway, deglaze the pan with 1 cup chicken broth. Dump into pot.
4. To the stew pot, add tomato paste, crushed garlic, bay leaf, salt, rest of chicken broth, sugar, and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to low, to maintain a steady simmer.
5. Simmer for about 2 hours, or until meat is tender. Skim excess fat, if desired. Finish on medium to reduce sauce. Taste for salt and pepper!

Garnish with sour cream and fresh marjoram, if desired. Serve over buttered egg noodles, potatoes, or rice.
