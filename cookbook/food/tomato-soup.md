# Tomato Soup (Bisque)

Adapted from [Chef John's tomato bisque](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/10/tomato-bisque-soup-might-not-count-as.html). Serves 6.

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)
- 1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons white rice
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

### Instructions

1. Sweat onions and celery in olive oil over medium heat. Add a pinch of salt to bring out liquid.
2. When onions soften and turn translucent, add garlic (and paprika, if desired) and cook for about a minute.
3. Add tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a simmer on high.
4. When a simmer is reached, stir in rice. Adjust heat to maintain a steady simmer for about 45 minutes, until rice and vegetables are very soft.
5. Blend until completely smooth. Stir in cream, then taste for seasoning. Stir in sugar to reach desired sweetness. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.

Garnish with fresh basil. Pairs well with grilled cheese sandwiches!
