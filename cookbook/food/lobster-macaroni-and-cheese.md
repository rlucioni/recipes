# Lobster Macaroni and Cheese

Adapted from [Chef John's lobster mac and cheese](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/02/lobster-mac-and-cheese-is-it-really-hard.html). Serves 2.

### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 lobster tails (5-6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups cold milk
- cayenne to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- pinch ground nutmeg
- few drops Worcestershire sauce
- 4 ounces grated sharp white cheddar cheese
- 1 ounce grated Gruyere cheese
- 1 generous cup elbow macaroni
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves

For the crumbs:
- 3 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tablespoon melted butter, or enough to moisten
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano Reggiano 

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.
2. Cut lobster tails length-wise.
3. Sear tails on high heat in a skillet with some vegetable oil on both sides.
4. Remove partially cooked tails, turn the heat to medium, and add the butter to the pan.
5. When the butter is melted, add the flour to form a roux. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes.
6. Separate lobster meat from the shells. Add the shells to a pot of salted water. Bring the pot of water to a boil and cook the macaroni.
7. Add milk to the roux and cook until it starts to simmer and thicken.
8. Add cayenne, paprika, nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and cheese. Stir until cheese is just melted. Keep sauce warm on low heat.
9. Strain pasta and transfer to the skillet of cheese sauce. Stir to coat evenly, adding a splash of pasta water as necessary to keep the mixture wet and saucy.
10. Add in fresh thyme leaves and chopped lobster meat. Adjust for salt. Transfer to a baking dish and top with breadcrumb topping. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown.
