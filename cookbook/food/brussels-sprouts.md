# Brussels Sprouts

### Ingredients

- 1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

### Instructions

1. Heat oven to 400&deg;F. Heat oil in a cast iron pan over medium-high heat.
2. Place sprouts in the pan in one layer, cut side down. Add salt and cook undisturbed until the bottoms begin to brown.
3. Transfer to the oven. Roast, shaking pan every 5 minutes, until very brown and tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Keep an eye on them; they soften quickly!
4. Taste for salt and pepper. Stir in balsamic vinegar.

Instead of balsamic, you can also toss the brussels sprouts with an [apple gastrique](apple-gastrique.md).
