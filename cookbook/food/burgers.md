# Burgers

Adapted from [Food.com's perfect burger](http://www.food.com/recipe/the-perfect-burger-92021). Makes 5 burgers.

### Ingredients

- 19.43 ounces 70% lean ground meat (16 ounces 85% ground beef chuck + 3.43 ounces pork fat works well)
- 1/2 large onion, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 large dashes Worcestershire sauce
- 1 egg yolk
- 5 burger buns
- burger toppings (cheese, caramelized onions, carmelized pineapple, etc)

### Instructions

1. Combine meat, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and egg yolk in large bowl. Be careful not to overmix. Store meat mixture in refrigerator until ready to cook.
2. Prepare all burger toppings.
3. Remove meat from refrigerator and form meat into 5 ounce patties that are the same diameter as the burger buns.
4. Heat cast iron skillet on medium-high heat until oil begins to shimmer. Reduce heat to medium and add burgers. 
5. Cook burgers for 3-4 minutes per side. After the last flip, add cheese and cover for 1 minute to melt cheese.
6. While burgers are cooking, toast the buns under a broiler. This will happen very quickly!
7. Allow burgers to rest on a plate for 2 minutes before transferring to the buns and adding toppings.

Serve with potato chips and a pickle wedge.
