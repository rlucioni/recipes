# Garlic Soup

Adapted from [Chef John's garlic soup](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/04/celebrating-national-garlic-day-with.html). Serves 2.

### Ingredients

- About 4 cups of cubed French or Italian bread
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more to drizzle on bread cubes
- 6 garlic cloves, grated
- 2 ounces ham, diced
- 1 generous teaspoon paprika or to taste
- 4 cups chicken broth
- Salt, pepper, cayenne to taste
- 3 large eggs

### Instructions

1. Toast bread cubes coated in olive oil at 350&deg;F until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add ham and warm through.
3. Add paprika and toast for a few seconds, then toss in garlic and stir briefly. Don't let it brown! Add bread and toss to coat in paprika-and-garlic-infused oil.
4. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, then reduce to medium. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
5. Fry the eggs and serve them on top of the soup.
