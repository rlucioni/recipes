# Ravioli

Serves 2.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh ravioli (e.g., porcini, butternut squash)
- 6-7 sage leaves
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 pound fresh mushroom ravioli
- grated Parmesan cheese

### Instructions

1. Shake excess flour off of the ravioli. Cut them apart with a sharp knife.
2. Bring lots of salted water to a boil, drop ravioli into boiling water, and stir gently so they don't stick. When the water returns to a boil, cook 6 minutes.
3. Heat olive oil on medium heat in a pan. Add sliced garlic and sage leaves.
4. Transfer ravioli to pan, working in batches if necessary. Sizzle for 1 minute, turning constantly.

Remove sage leaves before serving. Top with Parmesan cheese.
