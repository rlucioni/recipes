# Gunkanmaki

### Ingredients

- large square nori sheets
- sushi rice
- wasabi

Possible fillings:
- corn with mayonnaise and pepper
- marinate salmon roe
- chopped raw salmon mixed with finely cubed avocado

### Instructions

1. Find the parallel lines on a sheet of nori. Cut the first strip perpendicular to the line that is the same width as the distance between the lines.
2. Cut along the lines to get the remaining strips. Trim the first strip to be the same length as the other strips.
3. Use a moist hand to form a small ball of rice. Wrap a strip of nori around the ball so that the nori and rice form a bowl for the toppings.
4. Use a grain of rice to stick the end of the nori strip in place.
5. Add a bit of wasabi to the gunkanmakis that will be filled with raw seafood.
6. Top with a filling of your choice.
7. Eat immediately before the nori becomes soggy!
