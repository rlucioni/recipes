### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/3 cup Arborio rice
- 1 cup coconut milk (Aroy-D 100% coconut milk, found in cartons, works well)
- 3 cups milk
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla
- pinch of salt
- 1 egg yolk

Garnish
- 1/4 cup finely diced mango
- pinch of Chinese five-spice

### Instructions

1. Heat milk and coconut milk in a small pot until steaming. Turn off heat and reserve.
2. Melt butter in a larger pot. Add rice and sizzle for 10 seconds.
3. Add a ladle of the hot milk mixture and cook on medium-high heat until the liquid almost disappears.
4. Repeat until all the liquid is added and the rice is cooked to the desired texture.
5. Turn off the heat and stir in the sugar, vanilla, salt, and egg yolk. Stir quickly.
6. Portion into dessert cups and cover with plastic so that the plastic is touching the surface of the pudding.
7. Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator.
