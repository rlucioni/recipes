### Instructions

1. Start by preparing the dashi stock. Put kombu and water in a pot over medium-low heat. Remove kombu just before the water begins to boil.
2. Add bonito flakes and simmer for 30 seconds. Let cool slightly, then strain back into pot through a mesh strainer lined with a paper towel.
3. Turn the heat to medium-high and add shiitake mushrooms, soy sauce, mirin, salt, and ginger.
4. In a separate pot, boil noodles for two minutes. When the broth reaches a simmer, add bok choy bottoms, then tops.
5. Combine noodles and broth in bowls. Top with bacon and eggs.
