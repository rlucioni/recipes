# Sugar Cookies

Adapted from a Land O Lakes Holiday Recipe collection.

For cookie dough:
### Ingredients

- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

For lemon icing:
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 3-4 drops lemon oil

### Instructions

1. Cream sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl. Mix in egg, milk, and vanilla.
2. Add flour and baking powder, mixing until well combined. Scrape the bowl often!
3. Divide dough in half and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until firm (at least 2 hours).
4. Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.
5. On a lightly-floured surface, roll out dough. Cut with cookie cutters!
6. Bake until edges are lightly browned, about 6 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool completely before icing.
7. For the icing, mix powdered sugar with lemon juice and lemon oil. The icing should be slightly runny so that it spreads easily and dries hard.
8. Ice cookies and decorate with sprinkles. Allow icing to harden before eating!

Be careful with the lemon oil; too much wil make the icing bitter. The icing generally takes a few hours to harden.
