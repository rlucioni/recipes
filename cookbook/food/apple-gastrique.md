# Apple Gastrique

Inspired by the crispy brussels sprouts at Maven in San Francisco. Tops one pound of [brussels sprouts](brussels-sprouts.md).

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup apple cider or juice
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- Pinch of salt

### Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer over medium high heat for 15 minutes, or until you're left with about 1/4 cup. The reduction should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Toss with brussels sprouts. If it cools and thickens before you can use it, loosen it by adding a little water and putting it back over the heat.
