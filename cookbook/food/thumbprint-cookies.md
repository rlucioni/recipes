# Thumbprint Cookies

Adapted from a Land O Lakes Holiday Recipe collection.

For cookie dough:
### Ingredients

- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

For filling:
- 1/2 cup jam

For glaze:
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
- 2-3 teaspoons water

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.
2. Cream sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl. Add almond extract.
3. Add flour, mixing until well combined. Scrape the bowl often!
4. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Make indentations in the center of each cookie.
5. Fill indentations with jam. Cutting the corner off a Ziploc bag works well for this.
6. Bake until edges are lightly browned, about 14 to 18 minutes.
7. Stir together powdered sugar, almond extract, and water to make a thin glaze. Drizzle over warm cookies. Again, cutting the corner off a Ziploc bag works well.

Allow icing to harden before eating!
