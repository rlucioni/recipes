# Beef Rouladen

Adapted from [Chef John's beef rouladen](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/05/beef-rouladen-german-engineering-you.html).

### Ingredients

- 1 pound of skirt steak (or other long-cooking cut, such as round, rump, chuck, or flap meat)
- Dijon mustard, to taste
- Several strips of thick-cut bacon
- Paprika, to taste
- Onion, thinly sliced
- Dill pickle, cut into spears
- Cotton twine
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 4 cups beef or chicken stock, cold!

### Instructions

1. Cut the skirt steak in half. Butterfly both halves such that when the meat is rolled up, it can be sliced against the grain. Tenderize both halves.
2. Apply a thin layer of mustard to the inside of the meat. Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Lay bacon strips on the meat perpendicular to the direction of the meat fibers. Season with paprika.
4. Lay onion slices and pickle spears on the meat parallel to the direction of the meat fibers.
5. Roll from the larger end of the meat to the smaller end. Tie with twine. Season the outside of the meat with salt and pepper.
6. Brown meat well in vegetable oil over medium-high heat, about a minute per side. Reserve meat and reduce heat to medium-low.
7. Melt butter, then add flour. Cook roux for about a minute, then whisk in *cold* stock. Hot roux, cold liquid, no lumps.
8. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Transfer rouladen back to the pot along with any accumulated juices. The meat doesn't need to be completely covered!
9. Reduce heat to low. Simmer covered for 2 hours or until meat is tender. During that time, uncover pot occasionally and turn rouladen in the gravy.
10. Reserve rouladen to a bowl; allow to rest for about 5 minutes. In the meantime, reduce gravy on high (for about 5 minutes). Taste for seasoning.
11. Remove twine and cut rouladen into slices, perpendicular to the grain.

Serve with braised red cabbage and mashed potatoes. Don't forget to spoon over the gravy!
