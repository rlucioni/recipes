# Mashed Potatoes

Adapted from [Chef John mashed potatoes](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2007/03/perfect-mashed-potatoes-breaking-cycle.html). Serves 4.

### Ingredients

- 3 large Russet potatoes
- 1/2 stick butter
- 1/2 cup milk

### Instructions

1. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise, and add to a pot of generously salted water. Simmer until potatoes are tender, 25-30 minutes. Drain, then return the potatoes to the pot over high heat for 30 seconds to evaporate remaining water.
2. Mash two laps around the pot, add butter, then mash until butter is absorbed. Add milk and stir. Add salt and pepper to taste, then whip briefly.
