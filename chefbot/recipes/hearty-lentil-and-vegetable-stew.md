## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté onions until soft, about 5 minutes.
2. Add carrots, celery, and garlic; cook for another 3 minutes.
3. Stir in potatoes, zucchini, and red bell pepper. Sauté for 2 minutes.
4. Add lentils, diced tomatoes (with juice), vegetable stock, bay leaves, thyme, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 35–45 minutes until the lentils and vegetables are tender.
6. Stir in chopped greens and simmer for another 3 minutes.
7. Remove bay leaves and adjust seasonings as needed.
